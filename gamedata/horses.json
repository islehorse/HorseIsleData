		"description": "The original, and in the opinion of many, still the best, of the Warmblood Sport Horses is the Irish Sport Horse, formerly known as the Irish Hunter.  Unlike most warmbloods, only two breeds are used to arrive at this intelligent, athletic and versatile mount: the Irish Draught (which is, in reality, more of a heavy warmblood), and the English Thoroughbred.  This is a steady, reliable hunter/jumper which also excels at cross country and stadium jumping.  It can be any color and pattern of white with the exception of appaloosa patterns, and generally stands between 15 and 17hh.  (You'll notice that even the wild horses have neatly braided manes and tails.  The local leprechauns take care of that!)",
