		"text": "Katie was an ordinary girl, with one large secret. On her ranch, hidden in the Valley of Dreamstar was a herd.  A herd of pounding hooves, swishing tails, soft silky manes, and eyes that held nothing but compassion.  They were the Wild Horses of Dreamstar Valley.  Katie was the only girl who had ever gotten close enough to see them.  The lead stallion was a chestnut stallion with the Arabian face but the body of a Morgan and an Andalusian.  He had a white snip and a brown mane.  The lead mare was a beautiful palomino, with a dark grey muzzle, red tipped ears, and a barely visible white star on her forehead.  At night under the sparkling and grinning stars, a coyote can usually be heard, as the crickets chirp making music of their own.  Katie snuck out the front door quietly in her pajamas.  The barn was completely silent.  Not even the cows made a noise as she raced across the field and stopped to stare down upon a herd of around 24 horses.  The palomino mare rushed up to greet Katie, ears pricked forward as she trotted up the hill.  Slowly she held out her hand, a red apple sitting on the palm.  The wild mare flicked her ears slightly, but moved forward all the while staring into the little girl's eyes.  The mare ate the apple and let Katie pet her.  The mare left and Katie watched them, sitting down on a rock until it was, by her watch, almost midnight.  She rushed back home and fell asleep, dreaming of the next night with the wild horses. \r\n~The End~"

		"text": "High in the sky, the clouds moving slowly as the wind sweeps them around the world, there is a garden.  A garden of crystals, which shimmer as the sun peeks at them through the cirrocumulus clouds that scatter about the sky like a field of wheat.  The crystal garden lay on a large cumulus cloud, a cloud that is never ending white and fluffy but very thick.  In the garden, so very fair, lay a beast that is quite rare.  A mane of golden, hooves slight dark pink, gold wings with pink tips and sweet understanding black eyes.  In one swift motion, it disentangled itself from the crystals and burst through the air.  It whinnied a soft melodic noise, echoing through the air.  The Pegasus, her wings stretch sparkling as she dives through the clouds.  Never in fear of storming clouds, she comes home at night to her secret garden in the sky, safe among all the crystal. \r\n~The End~"

		"text": "The day was nice and peaceful.  The foals grazing by their mothers peacefully frolicking around in the green grass and the spring flowers. Grey clouds slowly rolled in towards the pastures.  The owners saw this and began to bring in the horses and livestock.  It began to rain.  The thunder clashed with the clouds and the lightning struck the sky like a flaming whip.  Some of the foals scattered, but all were caught and brought back to their mothers, except one little filly.  The filly had dashed away in fear and got lost in the little shade there was from the rain.  Under the four large trees, she could hear her mother calling for her.  Her neighs of fear, slowly fading and drowned out by the rain and the thunder. The small filly laid down leaning against one of the trees and tucked her head between her knees until she felt a pair of warm hands picking her up and laying her across something.  The filly squealed in terror struggling to get up and off whatever was holding her captive, but the figure just put a blanket and a warm hand over her.  Minutes that seemed like hours passed by, until they could see light.  The strange figure picked her up, rubbed her dry of all the water and put her in the stall where she met with her mother, happy as can be to see her filly once again. ~The End~"

		"text": "This is a tale of high adventures and seamanship.  Back in the days before recordings a large band of pirates roamed the lands, but, of course, as the group's size grew, there were arguments over leadership.  They eventually split into two.  The Skull Pirates took over the portion of Pirate Isle resembling a skull.  This was the larger of the two groups.  The Crossbones Pirates took the remainder for themselves.  Travel between the two islands is still restricted to this day.  They employ secret passwords and the like which only the captains are allowed to give out.  No one is sure what exactly caused the split, or what they still hold as grudges today.  What is known is that the Skulls seem to sail around the Eastern Seas, Near Saddle Isle.  While the Crossbones have been seen patrolling the Western Seas, docking occasionally at Bird Isle.  The Pirates are all notorious for their pearl use instead of money and most appreciate shiny rocks of all sort."

She sees unicorns and a Pegasus, while her brother sleeps in the bed next to her and as he listens to his mother singing the soft song, he dreams of the pirates and their wild crusades on their sturdy zebras. Their eyes slowly close as their mother continues singing softly as the rain pours down upon the house like a soft melody and the wind whispers like the voices of a chorus with no voices. As the night goes on the voiceless chorus fades into a bird's song as the sun begins to rise. \r\nThe End"

		"text": "In a dark forest, where the leaves barely allow the sun in, there is a meadow filled with butterflies and birds singing softly, where the wind whispers songs of tales forgotten and the trees move and speak with soft groans and grunts, there lived a creature of myth and legend. It was a creature so majestic and amazing that no one dare come near the forest anymore. Stepping out from the trees, came a creature with a long sparkling mane and a strange thing upon its head. Above a jewel that was right betweens its eyes was a horn, glistening and pale. The ears were long like a mules but rounded like zebras. It had a wispy beard and on its chest was long wavy fur. Its eyes fogged with knowledge beyond comprehension. This magnificent thing was the unicorn. No one had dared to go near it. Once in a while the youngest daughter of Erebus' daughters would come to listen to the wise ones tales of years ago. Secretly the unicorn wished he could be with his mare and foal, but they were separated by a large body of water. Both hidden in mazes, they dare not come out to humans eyes, though none would ever be able to catch him for he was too fast, too strong. That was how he would spend his life, hiding and watching as the world changed and the rains poured and the streams still rippled on. \r\nThe End"

No, not a fly, it wasn't a human noise either, no wait it was the sound of his heart beating so fast as the body under him moved with powerful strides. The powerful beast in need of no urgings rushed past the others on the soft turf. Ears flicked back as it's breathing becomes rapid like one simple motion. The clanging of metal flowed through his ears. Flags passed by as they reached near the other. The adrenaline pulsing through his veins was more than enough to make him scream in a mixture of a dozen emotions. With one swift slash of the whip the beast under him rushed forward surpassing the other grey creature. The other rider looked over in shock and then all he could remember was a flash and the beast under him slowing its sides heaving. He clung on with all his might as the creature reared into the air and came down shaking its head as people began to surround it a pad of flowers was put onto its sweating neck. He dismounted and patted the bay creatures neck. The once smooth coat was damp with sweat. He smiled they had won the race together as one. The End"

		"text": "It was raining, the mud slick, and the roads damp. All the animals were huddled together to wait out the storm, except one small foal. Only the rain and the tired step of the foal could be heard as he made his way down the empty plains. His small mane clung to his neck as he continued walking. He could see his own breath as it continued to rain. A young foal shouldn't be out in a storm like this. His head hung low he continued to bear through the storm. His once shining chestnut coat was now thick with mud and rain water. Snorting softly he made his way to a fenced area where he squeezed through to stand on a hard winding road. Finding this safer than the mud he continued on his way. Something large, with a fierce growl and bright eyes swerved past him and stopped. He stared, frozen, unsure of what to do. A figure came out of it. The figure picked him up ignoring his struggles and brought him into a dry, warmed cage, also known as a wagon. The figure grabbed something soft and warm from and began to dry him, while the other figure got the horses moving again and went home. From that day on the foal grew from a lost baby to a trusting, children loving chestnut stallion. \r\nThe End"

		"text": "Elves are a funny lot, addicted to collecting strange trinkets. They often have strange and unusual things: boxes with no bottoms, coats with endless pockets, buckets or cauldrons that grant wishes. Elves like cozy homes, though their terms of cozy vary between elves. One elf could simply love soft bright colors and fluffy chairs, while another elf could quietly adore a nice wooden chair set and dim lights. Elves are generally nice creatures, but there will be the occasional selfish elf. The secret to getting in an elf's home is to dig. Elves are picky about the trees they live in. If you dig in front of a willow tree you might just pop into an elf's house, and the elf would usually gladly greet you and shake you by the hand or offer you a cup of tea or coffee. So if someone mentions an elf, be prepared to dig to find their house, in case you need something from them, or you think they might like something! \r\nThe End"

Sacred items, jewels, and other symbolic creations were being carried to large stone heads of ancient people who were thought to be Mystics who created all of the elements and the animals. A man in a strange feathery costume walks forward. Raising his hands he shouts something into the wind and the people behind him, all in colorful feathered outfits, walk forward and set something in the ground near the stone head. Afterwards the winds die down and they cover up the precious offerings. The natives slowly decreased in their size and old rituals became locked in the back of their memories. Still, something inside says there is something important about those statues. "

The fruits are bountiful the animals are plenty, but in the end of the small trek through the dangerous traps and false paths a meadow filled with strange plants is found. Near the right just below the exit is a small hut. A crazy scientist used to live there, experimenting with the strange exotic plants and testing chemical substances on them. One day a chemical broke from the glass tube it was being held in, because of overheating, and splattered on the scientists favorite plant. The plant trembled grew, a huge mouth formed from the petals. It wrapped around the entire house, while a few more of these plants grew in the yard. The scientist left scared of the plants, but a native with a gift for growing things stumbled upon the entrance and proceeded to nurture and tame the large plants. Now he lives there with his daughter teaching her how to care for the environment."

It is the most perfect star sapphire ever known to exist. Its color is a pure ultramarine blue, and its star so pronounced and perfect that were sunshine to shine upon it, beams of light would refract from the star in six directions.  Legend passed down through the centuries tells of a great treasure of the Solomon family, buried in a special vault which can only be opened with the aid of this stone.  The stone was lost in antiquity, however; and its current whereabouts are unknown."

Birds flew overhead, small creatures frolicked around on the ground, foxes, deer, bunnies, and squirrels could be seen in many trees, chattering and twittering. Farther off in fields of flowers and clover, two young riders were laughing, riding on their large beautiful steeds. They joked as they rode along a small path that led to the forest, one with a butterfly on her horse's forelock, the other having a small white foal by its mare's side, jogging along.

		"text": " Jenny waited patiently for her parents to come home. Today was the day she finally got to go to the auction house and choose out her very own horse. Her skin prickled at the thought of her very own horse. Jenny could only imagine what type of horse she would be getting. A thin, majestic Akhal-teke with a sparse black mane, an elegant grey Arabian with an arched neck, and a long flowing grey mane that she could braid every day, or perhaps a chestnut Danish Warmblood, a horse she could win with in the jumping arena in the nearest town. The sound of her parents honking the horn on their old beat up truck jolted Jenny from her thoughts, and she rushed out to greet her parents. The ride to the auction center was short. Jenny stepped out of the truck, following her parents closely. The auctioning blocks were large, filled with many horses and very noisy. She passed by several stalls where little ponies, barely up to her waist, tried to look out of the pen to see the people passing by. Jenny looked around, she didn't have much to buy a horse because she'd put away half of her money for the tack she'd need. A buyer walked by, leading a large black Friesian towards the loading area.  She didn't know where to go, and her parents had disappeared into the crowd of people.  Not knowing what to do Jenny walked along the pens of several horses, passing by beautiful horses, many out of her price range. Across from the pens holding all of the champion bloodline horses was a small stall, out of the way, holding a tall bay stallion. His head was lowered, as if he were trying to avoid any attention at all. He had a large snip, two hind white socks and the largest brown eyes she'd ever seen, eyes that begged for a good home. Jenny slipped through the bustling crowd, to reach the stall of the bay stallion. She ducked into the pen, checking the horse's hooves, the firmness of the ankles, and the overall conformation. She asked the owner how much for him, hoping with all her might, that she'd have enough for the beautiful beast.\r\n\r\n \"The Gelderland be  three thousand on the spot.\" The seller stated in a deep voice.\r\n\r\n Jenny's parents came up behind her, almost making her jump. They'd heard the price of the horse and willingly paid for it.  Jenny grabbed the black halter from her parents and carefully put it on the bay's large head. Together they headed home, with her new horse."
