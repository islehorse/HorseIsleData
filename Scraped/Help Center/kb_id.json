For jumping, strength is primary while speed is secondary.  For dressage, conformation is primary while groom is secondary.  For draft, strength is primary.  In simple jumping, the stats account for very little of the actual score.  It is mostly random.

He likes red pine cones and will pay you $1000 for every one you bring him.  This object is worthless to bring to a store however.  By talking to NPC's you will learn which ones like specific objects."},

The two player games require two people in order to play.  If both are in the game room you need to click INVITE and the other will have to ACCEPT.  The multi player rooms can have a number of people in them at once.  Horse Run is an example where a number of players ride around on one of their horses collecting orbs.

So, for example, the Earton rock store isn't going to give you as much for a ruby as the Shellton rock store will.  This is true for everything but tack.
