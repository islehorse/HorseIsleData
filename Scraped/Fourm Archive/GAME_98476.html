I see we have a flash workaround, people are still playing, etc. I do want to keep playing on the game and such, so I'm wondering if a month sub is a wise investment right now or should we expect differently? Thanks</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by WildHorseRunning)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 12 2020 7:33am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>For me, it's $5, which I can afford every month, even if I don't get the 'full' value, so I'm more than willing to pay that for myself/a few others to keep supporting the game :) I'd be interested in hearing others' opinions!</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by WildHorseRunning)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 12 2020 9:07am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>To clarify, I mean 'full' value as in, the game stays up and running/accessible for the full 31 days of the sub. And I'm willing to keep supporting the game as long as it's available, largely because I haven't had a chance due to real life to pay proper respect to this game that was such a huge part of my childhood.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 12 2020 12:13pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Jor will be taking the game down possibly Sunday the 15th.  <BR><BR>He might leave it up longer, into Dec. anyway.  We don't really know.<BR><BR>So, it's up to you as to whether you want to do a $5.00 sub, there are No refunds.  <BR><BR>While we will most likely be able to access Flash games via the Projector, HI1 will still be taken down.  <BR><BR>Now, that said... Come 2021, if there are still enough people wanting the game, and assuming at least most are able to access the Flash games... He &quot;might&quot; spend the 100+ hours to re-program HI1 security and then, bring the game back up.<BR><BR>There are however no guarantees he will do that, it's a somewhat small possibility that he might do that.  <BR><BR>It's a lot of work for a very old game.  Whether he will do that or not I have no idea. <BR><BR>I hope so, but no idea.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by WildHorseRunning)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 12 2020 12:32pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Will he be taking down the entire site, or just the game itself? I liked 2, but honestly 1 has always been my favorite, and I've loved spending time in it now, and would love to keep doing so as long as it's available. If he takes down the entire thing, will he ask about interest on the 2 or 3 forums?</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by StraitPirate)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 12 2020 1:07pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I'd absolutely re subscribe if they took the time to bring the game back up, I know a number of other people who would, too.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by ChasingWillow)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 12 2020 1:19pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I would definitely continue to purchase month subs if the game was brought back, as well as the occasional pawneer order as well :)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by SilverSunsets)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 12 2020 1:49pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I would also absolutely invest to help keep the game up, I've honestly been griving for weeks, Horseisle 1 is probably my favorite game ever invented and it holds the special-est of places in my heart &lt;3</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 12 2020 10:29pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>The entire site will go down.  <BR><BR>Hopefully he will bring it back, but I don't know.

Will someone post in forums or news on HI3?<BR><BR>Cause I don't really see any other way to let people know that the game is up again when it is down for a couple months or longer.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by WildHorseRunning)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 14 2020 7:02am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I mean, I'll probably be obsessively checking the HI1 link *laughing out loud!* But it would also be nice to know where to keep an eye out for 'official' news; I have accounts on 2, E/LC, and on 3(though I cannot play 3 because my computer just doesn't like running it, and honestly neither do I for enough small reasons combining to make it not fun enough for me to try to push through my  computer performance), so I can keep playing 2 and checking 2 and 3 forums.<BR><BR>But still, having an idea of where to look for official news/give indications of interest would be helpful :)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by StraitPirate)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 14 2020 7:53am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Man I'd honestly pay more for a month sub if that's what they needed to bring the game back. HorseIsle's been like my Hogwarts *laughing out loud!* Safe place I could always come back to growing up, and even years down the road there's always familiar faces, people I used to know and play with, even if we weren't close buds. <BR><BR>That's a good question, where do we look for updates? I don't play 2 or 3.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 14 2020 12:43pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>If HI1 is brought back up it would most likely be posted in the news and/or the forums for HI2 and HI3.<BR><BR>It's not so much the money issue as the time issue.  It takes a ton of time away from HI3 that is needed on HI3 to work on a very old game.  <BR><BR>Again, IF Flash games are still accessible come 2021, Joe &quot;might&quot; be willing to take the time at that point to re-do the security for HI1.  <BR><BR>It would still be a few months probably before he could get that done it's exceptionally time consuming.  <BR><BR>And, during that time he would not be working on HI3 and he is needed on HI3, so... Mostly it's a time issue. <BR><BR>We will have to wait and see, I've no idea.  Just hope.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Wildflower)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 15 2020 7:50am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Would it be possible to send an email to HI1 players with updates about if or when HI1 will be brought back up once these forums close?

It figures. Too bad I went into web development and not game development, if I were able to help I'd be glad to do so, but I don't think much of the playerbase went into programming careers, *laughing out loud!*.<BR><BR>Alas, regardless, I'll get what little play time I can in and enjoy the memories.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR></TABLE><HR><FORM METHOD=POST>Add a reply to this topic:<BR><TABLE><TR><TD><TEXTAREA NAME=TEXT ROWS=4 COLS=60></TEXTAREA></TD><TD><INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE='ADD REPLY'></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=SUBJECT VALUE='NOT NEEDED'><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=FORUM VALUE='GAME'><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=VIEWID VALUE='98476'></FORM>[ <A HREF='?FORUM=GAME'>GO BACK TO GAME FORUM</A> ]<BR><BR><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 WIDTH=100%>
