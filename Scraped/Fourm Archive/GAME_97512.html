For a compromise, maybe we could have a tiered system? Like full interest for the new players, and then maybe half for the people with like 1b-6b, and then 6b+ only a quarter? Just an idea. It's harder for people like me, with 100% qp to get money now :)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by FinalOpal)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jan 22 2016 8:03pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Exactly. Although you guys upped everything regarding economy(quests, etc), most of the people with max money or close to that have already completed all the quests/other money makers, so it doesn't really help us. I think the tiered system is a great idea, and it'll continue to help the economy and reduce inflation.<BR><BR>(Although I think the interest should've stayed the way it was, that's just my opinion. :))</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Centauri)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jan 22 2016 8:03pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I agree with this.

It's not fair to players that have worked hard to earn a lot of money to have the same gain from interest as a player with only 100m in the bank.

If we go back to the 100m max,(easier number to work with) then thats basically just cutting 2 0's off the end of everything. so if we cut the last 2 numbers off everything across the board   (the money in everyones hand and in bank) then no one is really losing anything and it helps new players be able to catch up.

We're going to leave it as is,  just to see how things play out.   We ask that everyone make a go at it,  and if a tweak is definitely needed,  we can in a few weeks if needed.      <BR><BR>But by far,  the interest has always been way out of sync with the rest of the game.

As others have noted above, it's a drastic change in literally an instant. People went form 3M an hour to 75k. That's a 97.5% drop. I understand that the point was to combat inflation but consider that:<BR>1) New pellets were implemented to act as a sink to combat this.<BR>2) New players already could have participated in the economy by whispering, exp. training, and INTEREST. I started on grey last year and reached maxed bank due to interest ONLY.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Bula)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jan 22 2016 9:37pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I didn't see this form post and accidentally made a new one... <BR><BR>So I love the entire update and am really excited to play. <BR>The only real thing I have a problem with is the interest. Don't get me wrong, it's a fabulous idea for Pinto. The only problem I have is that on other servers, such as my home server Bay, the only way to make money to do anything with is through interest. And even making nearly 2m a day for interest, after 20 days you would only get 40m. I'm wondering if there's a way to fix this for the not so popular servers? <BR>I make my money for whispering and for renting pegs/unis and pellets through interest, as rarely anyone buys horses there anymore through interest.

I don't think I will be using any of the new additions now with the lack of interest, otherwise I will quickly deplete my bank account. Considering how hard most of us worked to build up our bank accounts I think it is disappointing that we lose the main benefit of keeping large amounts in the bank. I for one will no longer be spending money selling subs/POs or buying myself subs as there is no real benefit now.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by WhiteFang)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jan 22 2016 10:02pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Seconding Bula on that.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by LittleWolf)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jan 22 2016 10:10pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>While I'm not currently affected by this change, I know that I will. Especially since there are $1BIL+ tack sets, players like myself who have to save to buy these sets, the interest cut will make this a horrible goal to reach. There's only so much questing and mini-games can give you, interest helps out a lot when savings for items like this in the game. :/</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by CrimsonPetals)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jan 22 2016 10:29pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I agree with the earlier comment posted by Flames. Most of the recent additions were added with the intention of creating a money sink, these additions now seem null and void with the current changes to interest.<BR>The tiered system is an interesting concept, and I can't help but wonder why it was not more seriously considered as a viable option by administration. It is already difficult enough to entice new players to the game with the current economy, reducing the percentage of interest earned I fear will have a negative effect. As a relatively established player on the game, I still have a large quantity of savings. But newer players will struggle to adapt in the new economy where 'old money' still exists but the expense of tack and companions will be an ultimately unreachable goal.<BR>I don't disagree with the current efforts to adjust the grossly inflated economy, but I question such a drastic change. I’m happy to partake in a trial period to accommodate the new changes in the interest rate, but I think it is something that will inevitably have to be reviewed at a later date.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Centauri)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jan 22 2016 10:35pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I'd just like to add, that I think most of the players here really do appreciate all the new updates you've given us and how thankful we are to be receiving new content to the game.

Reording horses in the competitions has shown up randomly in the forums hundreds of times since the game was created. And now that we get one of the biggest game overhauls in several years, the FIRST thing we do is come here and bash one change? <BR><BR>So I would first like to say THANK YOU to Joe for recognizing some of the things that players have been asking for and giving them to us, and taking the time and effort to get our opinion and make those changes. <BR><BR>Now, I agree the interest rate was a drastic change, but is anyone going to agree the economy isn't out of control? It's a starting point, and Joe has said they can make changes based on how it goes for a few weeks. Maybe too much at once, but this forum just sounds kind of whiny and ungrateful and I can't argue that the idea wasn't good. <BR><BR>I'm perfectly okay to let this play out for a few weeks and reevaluate from there. I particularly like Aniya's proposal as a way to slowly scale us back and help people who were making interest on a full bank to adjust their thinking. But playing this way for a bit and giving it a fair shot is not gonna hurt anyone. <BR><BR>I also particularly like Bula's point about other servers, as they are now kind of toasted without other people to play with and little interest. I'm sure Joe will find a way to address this. <BR><BR>I'm glad we're still seeing big updates like this and getting things we asked for. Let's try to be a bit more grateful for it?</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Aniya)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jan 23 2016 7:59am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Sorry, i should state that i absolutely love Everything else about the update, and i dont even dislike the idea of putting a lower cap on the bank interest, i think it could be a very good idea, but i think right now 5b might be better then 250m since we are all used to trading in the billions, im not at all trying to whine :)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by WildFlight)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jan 23 2016 10:37am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>So. This new update was an interesting one. I'm one of the older players on here, I've hit max bank a while ago so this new Interest situation effects me a lot. <BR><BR>Part of me dislikes this new change, for obvious reasons. (my only income was from interest). And I would like it to go back to how it was. <BR><BR>However, I'm also very interested to see how all this will play out. Just see what happens to the economy and everything.<BR><BR>I'm willing to wait things out. Give this new system a chance.

Overall, the changes are amazing and I love them! Though, the interest change does put a damper on things. I understand that money has gotten out of control in some servers. However, for dead servers, such as my home server, I have no way to make money but through interest. I have completed every quest there is to complete and there is no one besides myself who is usually on the server. Granted, I haven't much reason to be spending money, but it was nice to be able to buy the top tack and pellets, especially the height and color ones.<BR><BR>However, it puts me off from wanting to do that since there is literally no possible way for me to ever get that money back due to the fact there is no one to sell horses to aside from the pawneer and currently there are no quests to be done. I do like the idea of having a tier system or maybe adjusting the interest based around the economy of each server. It kind of feels that one server is running the show on everything since all the money/players are there. That's just my thoughts on things. I'm willing to give it a try though.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Photographs)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jan 23 2016 11:28am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Don't understand how we're meant to buy the pellets or buy horses when we don't want to spend our money because we aren't getting interest. Nothing is selling whatsoever on Pinto because people don't want to spend their money. People on their home servers can't pellet horses now as they don't earn any interest, so they almost want to quit them. I do not believe lowering by this amount was in any way a smart decision. If it was halved, okay, that's fine. I mean 75k an hour? That's 60m a month. A Unipeg costs 50m for 2 hours. No one wants to use it. No one wants to use half of the new stuff simply BECAUSE of the sudden interest change. Half the players already want to quit, this doesn't encourage the growth of horse isle population at all.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Photographs)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jan 23 2016 11:31am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I'd rather have not had the update at all had I'd known that we would basically get no interest.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Photographs)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jan 23 2016 11:43am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I do LOVE everything in the new update but this, I wasted 10b trying to make a horse max height and it didn't work, and now I have no money or interest to rely on.

So, don't try to sell a horse for what you previously tried to sell it for.  Lower the price some.  Sell more in bulk than individually, you can make quite a profit this way, even now.  <BR><BR>2) You still gain interest, just not as quickly.  Plan your Horse Isle life accordingly.  Don't buy umpteen pellets, beans, droplets if you can't afford them.  Be patient, earn the money then buy them. :)  Actually makes them more important, as you had to work for them.  Not just spend here, spend there, and do little or nothing to recoup money.<BR><BR>3) We actually have to work at generating money now, or be patient.  We have been rather spoiled, spend a couple bill today, gain it back automatically by doing nothing in a few days with interest.  <BR><BR>4) The above allows for new players to have a chance to actually play the game and enjoy it.  I'm always hearing about how we need new players, the game is dying... Well, we get new players daily, what we don't get is new players who stick around.<BR><BR>Unless those new players have their own real life money to spend, they can't really enjoy the game.  Horses sell for billions, they have a few thousand.  Subs sell for millions to billions, they have a few thousand.  So, they leave.<BR><BR>The changes are in place to create a bit of a balance.  Rich players may stay rich, but...they will need to work a bit harder to stay there and it will take a bit longer. When they spend their money, it will take a bit longer to gain it back.  New players have a chance to earn money a bit faster and buy a sub = earn money even faster then (no play time limit and can have a ranch, more horses and windmills.)  <BR><BR>It will take players a bit longer to reach cap money, prices will drop a bit which will enable new players to be able for afford things thus giving them a reason to stay.<BR><BR>Lets give this a try.  It's not written in stone, and there are limited things Joe can actually do.  So trying to find something that will work without massively messing up what was, is a bit of a tight rope walk for Joe.  <BR><BR>So, lets be patient, work together and see if this current set up works. :)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Photographs)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jan 23 2016 12:45pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I'm really appreciative for what you do to keep HI alive, and I am sorry that it came off rude, but at the same time, it's a shock to find out I'm suddenly only earning 75k an hour when I wasn't given notice.

The economy is completely shut down as it is with the lack of players. Interest is literally the only way to make money if you have completed 100% of the quests on said server.

For example, if you have a max hh pinto Spanish barb and 15 people want it and they all continue to out offer each other until one pays the most, you have a high prices horse, and then when more are caught the other people will then pay more for those as well until there are an over abundance and the supply goes down. You brought the economy down by adding the height and color pellets to make it where everyone can get what they desire instead of having to out offer each other, which would, in turn make prices of horses go down. The economy would have leveled itself out that way and ended at a place where all players could easily get what they wanted. Newer players had a fair chance of getting what they needed as well with the amount to whisper and the luck of catching a rarity to sell for a high price, which has definitely happened.

I think all players, whether they are new or old, should have equal opportunity to make money. If this happens, more new players will probably stick around. Those who have all day or many, many hours to spend on the game increase their profit rapidly,while the players who don't suffer because they don't have money and can't buy horses seeing as the prices are too high. I don't want to rob players of their hard work, but I think it's sad that all the new players coming in, who don't have time to earn billions, can't enjoy the game because of all the money other people have. <BR>Let's say the max amount of money was decreased (probably a lot) and the cash you earn for quests was raised significantly. That way, it would take less time for new players to catch up, the game would grow, and the focus could shift off of money. If the general cost of things (pellets, tack, companions, horses) went down, we wouldn't need as much money in order to prosper. As for the older players who would have the max money limit, they could spent it on pellets and such to better their horses and would never have to worry about getting too much money. The interest rate should be high, so all the players could catch up to the others sooner than later. We shouldn't have to work forever to get money like in real life. Spending all night training, just to get money is not my idea of fun. Instead of doing all that, we could be questing, buying pellets and getting better horses, and not having to worry so much about money. I do think we should have to work for it, just not so much that it's taking hours and hours and hours of our lives. The oldies who are upset about losing their money need to remember first of all what's good for the game. Shutting out players and hoarding money is not helping horse isle. I think that for sure the interest should be enough to cover uni and pegi costs (however if those prices were decreased along with everything else, it wouldn't be a problem). We should be able to have a nice max money limit, where new players would still be attracted to the game because it wouldn't take light years to earn. Questing would be more tempting. <BR> If changing the costs of things isn't a possibility, this could still be achieved by raising quest money (I believe that can be done since it has already happened a little with this recent update) and giving new players a lot of money upon arrival. <BR>But, in my ideal world, the max amount would be lowered and the the amount you earn from questing would be raised. That way, the oldies would still have the max amount of money once the change took place. I don't don't think just changing interest rates will be beneficial or helpful, new players will still flounder. I know, because even when I was a new player, the interest didn't help much to boost the amount of money I had, because I didn't have almost any to begin with (compared to other players). I'm so excited to the prospect of change in horse isle! Many of my real life friends quit playing because they were flustered with the huge amount of money people had.

My 123k 100% UTed Dole, for example, and horses of that calibre, wouldn't be possible to sell at all otherwise.<BR><BR>However I don't know if coding a &quot;10 pellets total&quot; would be doable. So maybe, given that we now have 4 different pellets worth 1b, we should only be able to hold 3 of each. That's 12b in total, less if you consider the loss in profit when you resell. And if you were holding all 12, you could no longer collect interest as obviously you had nowhere to put it anymore.<BR><BR>Considering that the existing limit is 200(!) billion in pellets if you hold 50 of each of the 4, plus bank money...

That is what it took to get a horse you wanted. Paying high amounts. If you wanted the horse badly enough you would work to get it, most players are pretty nice and will wait until you had the money.

What has happened to the interest now is not a fair point at all, in fact the staff seems to have turned their backs to the old, loyal players.<BR><BR>Second of all, Horse Isle will never be massively played, it will always stay between the 4k-7k account limit with maximum 90+ players online in one server (a rare case). The reason is simple: there are better games out there. But it doesn't matter, we keep playing and I plan to for quite some time, simply because I love one thing this game has built itself upon: horses. <BR><BR>I like the idea of interest being removed, but ONLY if it has a huge player base and futher more, a lot of different ways to earn your money. We can test it out for the next weeks, maximum a month.<BR><BR>This is not the first time a game has done something like this.

I have done (and am doing) this. The only reason why I am holding 30b plus the rest is that I want in with a fighting chance IF that grey ISH that I have been looking for for 4 years is generated...

If everyone is set to the same max. amount then that is the most a horse can sell for (not including horse and tack trades), so if a horse is generated and put up for sale they will still be able to afford it. You cannot sell a horse for more than it is possible to trade, so the market would have to adjust slightly and follow the cap down a tiny bit.<BR><BR>If no one was able to hold more than x pellets, no one would be able to come in and win all the bidding rounds, so everyone would be in with a fighting chance, but not as long as some are still holding up to 100b in pellets once everyone else has stopped earning interest.<BR><BR>Again, I agree levelling things out doesn't feel fair to us, but if it has to happen this is in my opinion the least (the fairest if you will) of two evils.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Catelyn)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jan 26 2016 12:40pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>BAsically people who already has high amounts saved, will still have enough left to buy their expensive dream horse since said horse cannot be sold for more than that max. amount.<BR><BR>Thus excess pellets can safely be used on other horses, IF a pellet cap happens.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Trotalot)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jan 26 2016 12:46pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I can't respond anymore, there's a limit on how many times I can repeat things I have already said xD</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Flames)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jan 26 2016 5:35pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I agree that there may be an issue that some players will hold pellets for a very long time and as you said have an &quot;unfair advantage&quot;. However, consider that there will likely be very few. Consider this: A player holds 50 pellets of each kind. Implement a 10 pellet cap of each without taking away the ones earned. Said player holds the pellets. What can they do if they don't spend it? Whisper? Well sure, but any horses would likely have to be given away for free since they can't accept anymore money. Exp. train? Sure. Still can't accept anymore money. My point is that since it's interaction based, you're literally at a standstill until you spend. <BR><BR>My point of bringing in the dream horse example was to illustrate that many of us have a lot of pellets now. Not to say that we need to continue having said amount of pellets to buy our dream horses, which is what it seems to be misconstrued as. It was to say that we have a lot which we EARNED that we don't want to go to waste.  <BR><BR>As for the interest cap, they aren't taking away what is earned as none of us had actually earned that interest yet - interest is a time based concept. In comparison, people have spent real money/time earning cash already sitting in the form of pellets. How many players will be impressed if you tell them &quot;hey, you just paid $40 USD for 5b&quot; but now you have to get rid of it within a month or its all gone. Now accumulate that over 8 years worth of spending and what do you have?

The rules have been changed, basically, so what we're getting now is an entirely unknown entity. Is subscribing going to be as attractive now? Surely not, if we cannot play.<BR><BR>I only have seventy days left of my year sub at the time of writing this, and had not imagined I would find myself in this situation where I am actually waiting to resub instead of just going ahead.<BR><BR>I see the standstill issue. I guess the question is how many players would be willing to remain at a standstill and for how long? Even by leaving the excess pellets I think people would be spending almost as fast as they would if they HAD to before a set date.<BR><BR>Say you implement a pellet cap (which I maintain is an excellent idea!), I'll use me as an example, I would personally spend the excess so I could get on with selling my horses. Otherwise I would effectively be sitting without being able to play, for an unforeseeable length of time. You literally could not predict how long you would be unable to play for, but the odds are not in favour of a short-term break in play... There is only one horse I save for, and four years on it still doesn't exist on Palomino. Of course, if a player has an already existing horse they are wanting to pounce on if sold, it takes some of the unknown time aspect away since the horse at least exists.<BR><BR>But I don't know how many players who would be happy to have no horses come or go on their account for months and possibly years on end?

Pellets will only work as the sink they were intended for if you cannot hoard them. Therefore, reinstating the old interest and putting into place a pellet cap is the only logical solution. That way there will be no more money going into the game than what people have to spend, but we can still recoup and the economy will be moving as opposed to now.<BR><BR>With a pellet cap, the gap that new players have to work towards closing becomes manageable.

I have only logged on twice in the last 3 or 4 days because I have nothing to do now. My main enjoyment from the game was whispering and slowly pelleting one of my horses. I do not have pellets stored nor do I have a maxed bank balance. I am not poor nor am I one of the super rich. <BR><BR>I spend on average 10m+ a whispering spree, yet in 23 hours I make only 1.8m. It would take 10 days of being off or not spending any money to recoup a few hours of whispering money. <BR><BR>Before I'd pellet my project horse once a month, wait, and save interest until I had enough to pellet again the next month. It took a long time with my last pellet pony. But I was ok with that. Now my current pellet project is on hold. There is no way to make the 1b back. <BR><BR>I'd love to try out the new pellets, but won't because I'll have no way of recouping that money back. Mini games and new quests won't do that. Windmills (I have 8 up) don't pay out enough to do that. <BR><BR>For now I do nothing. No more whispering. No more pelleting. I'm stalled in the game. I log in once every 2 days to &quot;check&quot; in but that is about it. <BR><BR>I appreciate the thoughts in trying to even out the economy. I really do. But this is not the solution. Instead, long term players will stop playing the game or spending money altogether. I know I have done both.]]]<BR><BR>agreeing to this, too... i've all but stopped playing due to such a drastic change. part of the reason we whisper so much is to have fun and spend some of our money. such a drastic change may be fun for new players, but as for the ones that have been here, i kind of think we're the best bet on horseisle's total economy. at least real-money investment-wise. you know we're here to stay. to do something so drastic to those that have supported the game through thick and thin... i don't know how to feel about it. at least they're admitting that it might need changing instead of setting it into stone, so that's kind of a relief. definitely agreeing with the cap system.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Catelyn)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Feb 1 2016 11:49am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>^ Precisely. If changes need to be made, the best thing to do would be to make a change that doesn't affect established players so much, eg. a pellet cap. It doesn't affect the way we play the game, it only 1. ensures we have to spend to save up, and 2. ensures no one can hold above x amount. New players will know no differently when they sign up, and take it as it is, so for them the type of solution doesn't matter.

And I am not sitting comfortably. I play Bay and all I do is whisper, however no one is forcing me to spend my money. I understand the urgent need for the return of the old interest, but what if it doesn't change? We need to learn to deal with it. Many of you think this change revolves around Pinto, but it doesn't. Every single one of the servers is extremely inflated. The point of the drop in interest is to fix that. No one should be holding onto 50b+ anymore. They're trying to take the &quot;normal economy&quot; we took for granted and return it to what it once was. That means lowering horse, subs and po prices. Remember when players used to pay $1/10k a server? And now everyone is buying $5 subs and selling them for 1b. Tell me how that evens out? We have taken enough advantage of the inflation. Buying pellets is not suppose to be a commonality, it's suppose to be a luxury item. I understand the dilemma with dead servers, but there is nothing we can do about that. In all honesty, their solution to that is just advertising. I bet if they stuck a Horse Isle 1 ad in some equine magazine things would get better. But they don't, and we can only recruit so much from other servers. I promise you they aren't ignoring this matter. Every one of us is affected by this change. Just give it time.

However if the seller and I agree on the sum of 5b, it either means that a) I have to trade 5 pellets + 500m to make up for the resell loss, or b) the seller has to accept a resell loss of 500m and an actual sale price of 4.5b.<BR><BR>Players like me have taken a MASSIVE hit with this update. The new players are probably happy until they realise they can't make money past 250m. But what about the rest of us?</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Catelyn)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Feb 15 2016 1:57pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>And with the added magic residue tag, pellets have lost a lot of their value to me. I don't want to put that tag on my horses that I have had for four years, so what am I supposed to do with the pellets? I don't want to sell them at a loss, I don't want to spend them and make my horses look less attractive. I just have nothing that draws me into playing anymore.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Jor)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Feb 17 2016 2:02pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Locking this,  since additional changes have been made with latest update, and way to unwieldy ;)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR></TABLE><HR><B>THIS THREAD IS CURRENTLY LOCKED, NO NEW POSTS AT THIS TIME.</B><HR>[ <A HREF='?FORUM=GAME'>GO BACK TO GAME FORUM</A> ]<BR><BR><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 WIDTH=100%>
