Please don't scold us. :)<BR><BR>We are currently near Los Angeles, and recently stayed with Mod/Admin DesertPaint.  It was a good time, and allowed us time to focus more on work rather than staying at a noisy parking lot RV park, or in the middle of the forest with slow internet.. . .    So, we were wondering if anyone else would like to have us stop by on our route.<BR><BR>Our plan (I think) is to work our way up to North west Montana over the next few weeks. ..  So, if you meet the following please email Miranda directly by substituting her name in, instead of support before @horseisle:<BR><BR>1) Want to hang out with us a bit.  We are low maintenance.  We travel with everything we need, except a bathroom,  since the Cats needed the space. . .(Don't ask)<BR><BR>2) Over 18.  We don't really want to be putting out anybody's parents.. .  And maybe let us know your general family/living situation.  If you have 4 HI kid players,  that may be difficult to keep our &quot;Secrets Safe&quot;!  hahahaha<BR><BR>3) Let us know what kind of parking you have?  On street or country property, etc.   If it's below 20 at night,  we may need an extension cord for a little heat ;)<BR><BR>We aren't sure of the route yet, and can't give any specifics, but if we have your info and it's on the way,  we'd appreciate the visit I'm sure.  We can payback the favor with dinner, or maybe a &quot;Sneak peak&quot;. . . . . <BR>hahahah   <BR><BR>Thanks much,<BR>-Joe</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by OrbWeaver)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Dec 1 2009 7:56pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Doesn't sound like you'll be going through the Midwest.
