We have mythological creatures on both HI1 and HI2.  It is allowed.<BR><BR>Things such as Norse are not religious, that refers to Scandinavian origins or a place/people.  We allow Norse Mythology such as Valkyrie, Odin...  Just as we allow Greek Mythology and Celtic Mythology... :)<BR><BR>What we don't allow is players stating they are for example: Protestant, Catholic, whatever...that they go to church or quotes from religious books.<BR><BR>Religion is separated from Mythology on Horse Isle.  <BR><BR>The object is:  We don't want players preaching to others.  We don't want others who do not share those beliefs to be offended.  After all this is a game, not a religious forum.  Players here are from all over the word with many different beliefs.  It's none of our business what belief they do or don't have so we ask that they keep this to themselves.  <BR><BR>Players do not come here to be offended by others, they come here to get away from reality for a while and just have fun.  :)<BR><BR>If unsure of something or unsure what it should be classified, please ask. :)<BR><BR>Thankies</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by RockPile)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 3 2011 3:14pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Thank you, DP, for the clarification =)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 3 2011 8:07pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Bumpy :)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Korrailli)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 3 2011 8:15pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Would this apply to atheists and agnostics as well?

If it's not regular classical mythology, then it needs to go.  If it's mythology then it can remain as long as they don't say they &quot;worship it.&quot;  That part would need to go. <BR><BR>Basically we don't allow players to worship anything on the game regardless of what it is.  *laughing out loud!*</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by JerseyHotblood)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 4 2011 1:01pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Thanks for the clarification :)  Wasnt sure on one of those...As I did ask for a removal, I will talk to the player :)  I have no problems admitting when I am wrong :)  She was very understanding for the most part..and I did tell her If I was wrong I would absolutely apologize :)  After all...this is also how we learn to become better mods :) <BR><BR>Thanks again ;)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by JerseyHotblood)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 4 2011 5:11pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Ok, I did ask the player to contact admin if she felt it was ok, And I know she did, *laughing out loud!*  My prooblem is, I DONT rememebr which player it was :(  I thought I wrote the name down in notes but i didnt....Can you please, DP, let me know the players name so I CAN tell her I made a mistake?
