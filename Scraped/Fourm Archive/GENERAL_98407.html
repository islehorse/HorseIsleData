It would certainly make both HI1 and 2 more enjoyable and playworthy again. Especially for the long term players or those who stick around even after all the ups and downs. :)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by MellyMonster)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Mar 17 2020 8:11am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Any sort of feedback/acknowledgement from J&amp;M themselves would be greatly appreciated but I doubt this will happen?

There were over 30 people on yesterday. I've suggested lowering the price of pellets and high end tack about three times to adhere the poor economy.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by MellyMonster)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Mar 21 2020 11:08am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Tbh I think it's rude how there's no update, or personal feedback from the owners, it takes a few minutes to reply in this day and age.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Red)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Mar 22 2020 5:06am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>We had almost 60 players online today.

There are no plans at all to shut them down.  However we also need to be realistic, And... It's possible the games might need to be &quot;tweaked&quot; a bit to work with whatever comes up, so adding new content only to have to tweak it is kind of counter productive... <BR><BR>To add to this our artist's computer did a complete crash with the hard drive.  On that hard drive was the software to create horses.  At this time, it's old software and no longer available, so she can't get it again, though she continues to search for it.<BR><BR>Adobe Creative Suite 4 or 5.  For those of you who want to know. *laughing out loud!*  The game is done in 4, 5 will allow you to convert to 4 but that's it. <BR><BR>New quests and other content can be added, but again right now the time and focus is HI3.  As that game will continue, is flexible and can be added to, updated, etc.  <BR><BR>Probably about August or September we will know more about Flash accessibility.   And whether or not we can get more content in, if it can be in the exact same format, or what... <BR><BR>Hang in there!  :)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by MadHare)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Mar 24 2020 7:46am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Thanks DesertPaint.
