This includes players re-subbing time after time. The mods who gave up their time to put out dumpster fires and ensure the game remained enjoyable for us. The admins who sorted through countless flags and vios and e-mails. And of course to Joe and Miranda, for continuing to pour their heart and soul into this game and update it even after HI3 went live. <BR><BR>Without all of you, this game surviving this long wouldn't have been possible. So thank you to each and every one of you! I guess I'll see you on HI3.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by SensationalCat)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Oct 20 2020 6:34pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I should add also the coders who helped Joe, and the artists over the years.

I've appreciate playing on the platform you created. What a crazy thing to think that this game is a staple childhood memory of many people, including me. I absolutely will miss bouncing around the isles, having drawn-out conversations with NPCs, enjoying server cookies, and racing to solve chat riddles. Thanks for our sweet pixel horses that we will miss so dearly.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Borealis)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Oct 22 2020 6:38pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I can honestly say this whole ordeal made me tear up, it's almost like losing a friend. I didn't expect to be this sad, but HI1 was always a constant, an escape. When I was a little girl, I would have fantasies about being swooped up into this world and my biggest worry was finding enough ebony logs for some NPC. I'll miss it, and the happiness it brought me as a kid, likewise as an adult.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Eurydice)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Oct 22 2020 7:04pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Literally crying while reading this.

Thinking about all my online friends I made over the years. Horseisle was truly my escape growing up and it's crazy to think that throughout 13 years, I have continued to find my way back.

I hope that this game sticks around for a long time yet, or gets revived with better upgrade, since there are still some dedicated players, but regardless, thank you for a formative experience of my childhood.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Lioness)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 12 2020 8:02pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>As we get closer to the end, I just want to say thank you to staff who worked on this game for years. Not only was this game every horse girl's fantasy, but I also want to commend one if its greatest aspects: the players who make up this community. This game got me through middle and high school. I was not one in the &quot;in crowd,&quot; but I found my place here in this niche community and was fortunate to grow up alongside of many of them as we navigated that awkward stage together. Most of these players I never got to know their real name, but I will always remember them and our weird times together on our small little server (White). &lt;3</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Wildflower)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 14 2020 4:36pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Horseisle has been a reliable escape from reality for more than a decade. I'm so impressed with how well thought out the entire game is and with how dedicated its creators and support team are. Really, really, thank you all so much. <BR><BR>I've been one of those players who pops in to play excessively for a month or so until the busyness of life takes over, goes dormant for a few months, then returns... etc. No matter how often or how little I played, the horseisle community was always helpful, kind, and welcoming, and I think that's really special. <BR><BR>Thank you all &lt;3 I'll miss this so much.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Everyone)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 25 2020 2:51am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Wow I'm devastated to hear this news... I haven't been very active at all the last few years, but I loved logging in every few weeks to check if there's a new quest or breed available. Thanks for making such a unique game - if they made one, I would definitely play a desktop version that just has NPCs.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Sparklie)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 30 2020 5:27pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I started playing this game as a child over a decade ago. I've literally grown up with this game and franchise. It's the only game (not even horse game, just in general) that I've found myself coming back to. Thank you to everyone who made this game what it is, and for the priceless memories I've made because of it. This game will never be replaced, and while it's sad to see it go, I'm grateful for the over a decade of fun we had.<BR><BR></FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Everlend)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Dec 6 2020 10:18pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Thank you all for our countless years of hard work on this game. I remember when this game was being beta tested. I have enjoyed this game immensely over the years and have created many lasting memories.
