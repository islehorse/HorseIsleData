Poor Pipsy looks to be the only contributor to the forums haha!<BR>I nip on from time to time just for an hour here and there when I can, other than that super busy with the kids and studying BA honours degree in Business Management specialising in Accountancy at uni. Never really see anyone while on but probably because I'm in the UK rather than the US. <BR>For those of you that know Homer, he's good. Started a new job last year driving buses so he's working 70 hours a week doing that and loving it! We are like passing ships in the night at the moment but hoping to have some time together next weekend. <BR>How is everyone else doing? Anything new or exciting happening?</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Piper)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 11 2017 9:05am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I'm still around although life has taken over in the form of work, and I try to get on every once in awhile when I can. Back in the the last part of August, me and my boyfriend took a road trip to MO for a few days. Sure.. takes about 10 hours to drive down from MN, but coming back, we left there around 10am , stopped at the Titanic Museum, and got back in MN around 3am Sunday morning. We had left the Wednesday before, so I was tired being that I was up since 8 am that day. ugh, over 19 hrs of being awake. Sometimes I wonder how people do it!  <BR>I got my 5 yr award from work this year  so I am happy about that. Now, for thanksgiving, I'll go to my brothers, which thankfully is only about 1 1/2 hours away from where I live.  No plans for Christmas yet although one of my housemates here keeps asking me about Easter plans..Oh help me! It cracks me up sometimes and then it just gets annoying. <BR>It took me a little longer to get the quests done this time as i got stuck on one of them, but they did get posted so check them out!<BR>Pipsy</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Everlend)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 11 2017 3:01pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I'm still around as well.

I'm doing my level 3 in Health and Social Care so I can start studying to be an Assistant Practitioner next year, which is one step away from nursing. Exciting plans, we'll see how they go!<BR><BR>Being an Auntie is one of the most amazing experiences.

I got a Kindle fire from my sister and her family that live in North Carolina and from my other sister, her daughter and her daughter's better half, they sent me some frosted drinking glasses with the Minnesota state on it and everything that Minnesota is known for.<BR>One thing however is that my next Christmas will be this coming January 7th at my brothers and I'm happy but kind of nervous at the same time. You see we draw the names that we buy for anonymously on a web site and I got my boyfriends name.<BR>All he wants is gift cards to restaurants like Culver's, Denny's. Bakers Square, Hu Hot, (Mongolian rest, a buffet you go through and they grill or cook your food on this huge grill. Cool to watch. Or he said &quot;Surprise me.&quot; Now saying that to a mod? Watch out.<BR>Okay, so here's his &quot;surprise.&quot; I finally got the ring paid off, and I'm wrapping it up and giving it to him on our Christmas. What he's gonna say, I have no idea! Other than that he's getting popcorn and a candle from me. I hope all goes well cause I'm nervous as all get out!<BR>I'll keep you updated!

I have an appointment on Friday (the earliest they could get me in) to see what I did to it. <BR>To add as they say insult to injury, I had gone to the store to get a brace for my knee, brought it home and tried it. A One size fits most. Most yes. Me? no. So I had to return it. <BR>So I hobble around the house here only going up and down the stairs if need be.  <BR><BR>By the way, I told you all what he'd say to the present I gave him? He said yes!</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by CometChaser)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jan 26 2018 10:20am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Hello, I still try to hop on here when I can.
