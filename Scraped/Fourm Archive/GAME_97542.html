No one is buying OR selling since they will either be buying with no chance to recoup, OR they will be forced to sell at a big loss.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jan 25 2016 3:22pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>It's to help balance the economy.  For a little while it will be a bit of a mess, but it should level out in a few weeks.<BR><BR>Older players who are maxed with money were getting a huge, amount of interest.  New players had no hope of competing with that for a few years.  So new players had no hope of having a good horse, good tack, good companion unless they had real money to spend on a sub etc.  <BR><BR>Now, new players gain money faster via questing which pays more.  Older players have to wait much longer to gain such interest, and won't be spending billions for every little thing necessarily as it won't accrue as quickly.<BR><BR>There are money sinks as well for those who wish to use them.  <BR><BR>Interest is accrued (gained) on all money up to and including 250mil.  After that whatever is in the bank does not gain any interest.  So, yes you may save up into the billions, but it will take a while to get there now.  <BR><BR>Thus new players have a chance to buy things from current (older) players.  Once things level out a bit anyway. :)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Starbuck)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jan 25 2016 3:24pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Thanks, DP. I do think the reasoning is flawed as it relies on older players suddenly being willing to drastically lower their prices and taking losses without recouping. We currently have an interesting discussion on that in the other thread, and I hope some of our ideas could be considered as alternatives.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jan 25 2016 7:41pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Joe would like us to give this current setup a really good try.  Then re-evaluate.  If it's totally not working he is willing to work on it some more.  <BR><BR>But he would like it if we at least made a really good valiant effort with it as is currently is. :)<BR><BR>That will also help show him what is working and what isn't working...</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Catelyn)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jan 25 2016 7:48pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I do very much appreciate the effort put into it, from all of you.<BR><BR>The other longer thread took an evenmore interesting turn and we might have a very viable alternative to the interest, if an alternative proves to be needed. :)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DixieCup)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jan 26 2016 9:36am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Thank you for further explanation!</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR></TABLE><HR><B>THIS THREAD IS CURRENTLY LOCKED, NO NEW POSTS AT THIS TIME.</B><HR>[ <A HREF='?FORUM=GAME'>GO BACK TO GAME FORUM</A> ]<BR><BR><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 WIDTH=100%>
