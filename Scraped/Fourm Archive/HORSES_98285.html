Belgian because they are in dire need of a tune a up. Clydesdale because they have very little resemblance to the breed. POA because all of the patterns clash. Even the color of the Shire could be redone. twh Could use a definite touch up and So could the Paso Fino to look morecrealistic.<BR><BR>If the Azteca can be redone there is no reason why these ones cant because I thought they looked fine.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by SwanSong)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jul 29 2018 12:45pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>DesertPaint already said above: <BR><BR>&quot;Some can't be as the original file isn't available. <BR><BR>Many players like the current version and don't want their horses re-done so there are some breeds that in the past have been nixed do to player choice on re-do's.&quot; (Other players have opinions too and  many may not want certain breeds changed.) <BR><BR>Those could be some reasons why your suggestions would not be redone.
