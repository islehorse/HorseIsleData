Especially for the older breeds, the style is so different from what it is now that it would look very off to keep the old colorings.  That said, I will be informing the artist to only update the current colors but keep the current markings, etc.  Try not to change it too much.  So, if a color has two socks in chestnut and a blaze in black, then the redone art will still have two socks in chestnut and a blaze in black.  The shading and detail would just be updated along with new colors added.  The lineart would only be tweaked to fix conformation issues that have been noticed.<BR><BR>I'll be giving the breeds with the most votes to the artist to have her start working on them.<BR>Thanks!</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Catelyn)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Dec 15 2016 12:42pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Does this mean the Standardbred will be redone, then.
