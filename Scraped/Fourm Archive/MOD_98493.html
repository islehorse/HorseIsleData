Some players also ('Bonify' and 'Rebel' to name but a few) appear to a have pegasus/unicorns/unipeg in their horse list to 'keep'. <BR><BR>If this is true, understandably it's not fair for some players to have an advantage over others due to a hacker. Obviously the current situation with the game has changed, so I don't know if anything can be done to remedy this? Sounds like it could be a mammoth task if anything could be done.<BR><BR>Thanks :)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jun 30 2021 9:36am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>We are ignoring this.<BR><BR>Joe has (hopefully) blocked the hackers access to player accounts/database.  Also hopefully, from going onto my account... &gt;.&lt; <BR><BR>As long as all he does is mess around with pellets, unipeg's etc.  Fine.  <BR><BR>The only answer to stop that is to close the game down permanently.<BR><BR>So if players are having too much of a fuss about this Joe will just close HI1.  <BR><BR>The work to attempt to block this is tremendous, the game is very old, there aren't many players any longer so he is not willing to take away from HI3 time to try and fix this.  <BR><BR>Basically HI1 is left up for nostalgia and the few players that are still enjoying it. Hopefully it will stay up for a while!  <BR><BR>At this time it is supporting itself, at least most of the time which also helps keeping it up.<BR><BR>But if it's too much of a problem for players to deal with the cheating of 1 person then Joe will just take the game down. <BR><BR>Players need to just ignore the unipegs/pegasi/unicorns.  Pretend they don't exist.  So if someone has some maxed they need to take the stance of &quot;don't care&quot; and go on about maxing their horses.  <BR><BR>For those players who have used some of the given extra pellets to promote their horses, just ignore those horses.  They don't exist as it wasn't done fairly, so not important.  <BR><BR>That would if we could just get the players to do this, eliminate the issue.  But it's up to the players if they want to get worked up over it. *laughing out loud!*</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR></TABLE><HR><FORM METHOD=POST>Add a reply to this topic:<BR><TABLE><TR><TD><TEXTAREA NAME=TEXT ROWS=4 COLS=60></TEXTAREA></TD><TD><INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE='ADD REPLY'></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=SUBJECT VALUE='NOT NEEDED'><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=FORUM VALUE='GAME'><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=VIEWID VALUE='98493'></FORM>[ <A HREF='?FORUM=GAME'>GO BACK TO GAME FORUM</A> ]<BR><BR><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 WIDTH=100%>
