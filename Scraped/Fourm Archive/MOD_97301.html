I think she was just having a gripe, but if players have 'I am an adult player' in their profile, does it have to be removed? We have a thread further down that says people are allowed to say they are in college, is this still true or has it changed?<BR><BR>She said that she was told to remove an age range by DP from her profile, and then said that apparently having 'Im an adult player' in your profile isn't enforced? But she's confused me as she said that she had 'Im an adult player' in her profile and was told to remove it. I thought age ranges weren't allowed, but decided to check up on it *laughing out loud!*. She said DP said to report players with age ranges, so I told her she should just be reporting it then as asked, if she sees it, but she said 'yea, but it's not enforced'. So I wasn't sure if she was telling the truth or not, and I didn't want to be seen as telling her to report something if she shouldn't be.<BR><BR>So now I'm thoroughly confused and decided just to get a clarification on this. I think she's just up for causing trouble. *Sigh* I did stick up for you DP *laughing out loud!*, she was just having a moan I think, but I just wanted to clarify for myself. XD<BR><BR>And now she's mailing and PMing me every player that has 'adult player' in their profile *rolling on floor laughing!*</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jul 22 2015 4:42pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Yes please, it does need to be removed.  I was being nice and asking instead of deleting. College covers a huge age range, sometimes teens and up.  So we do allow players to say they are in college.  But no other type of school is allowed.<BR><BR>The issue is the younger kids do not understand why they can't have &quot;teen&quot; or &quot;pre teen&quot; in their profile when someone may have &quot;adult.&quot; We don't give violations for adult, but we do ask players to remove it. It's not fair to others.<BR><BR>On HI2, most...players are older or supposed to be a bit older thus usually can understand the difference. (Well, it's supposed to work that way anyway.) *laughing out loud!*</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Elanor)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jul 24 2015 12:10pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Thanks, DP! I did say at least three times 'DP would not have been like that with you' due to her ridiculous 'she was picking on me' claims but she would not listen so I gave up with her. *laughing out loud!*! Crazy kids. <BR><BR>*Nods* I have asked several people to take it off now, and will keep an eye out for it. I did tell Dally that anyone with it on would be asked to remove it, I think she was just out for an argument haha.

I am now!
