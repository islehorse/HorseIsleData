Here is my 2 cents, Miranda may wish to change or tweak this.<BR><BR>Players may talk about Twilight, Harry Potter, Lady Gaga, etc. just not in global.  Twilight and Lady Gaga are not rated for this game, they basically are PG 13 with players here under 13, so this needs to be moved out of public chat.  Can be chat here, buddy (if ok with all buddies) or pm.  <BR><BR>For HarryPotter, might not be ok for some of the really young kids, however it's basicall a PG movie.  It does start fights and unless everyone on the server at that time wishes to talk about it, it should also go into private chat.  <BR><BR>They may say anyone want to talk about Harry Potter, or Twilight... meet me ...  or pm me...  That's fine.  <BR><BR>What isn't allowed is flooding chat (maybe ok for a few minutes in playing, but not continuously,) talking about something that bothers others, controversial topics such as politics or religion.<BR><BR>No offensive content such as biting, licking, eating others.  Some of that is also violent, but mostly comes under offensive.  <BR><BR>Global is to chat in a general environment, something that should involve most of the players online at that time may be a server wide chat, that's fine.  As long as it's not argumentative or offensive or cruel in any way.  Asking for help for a quest, or how to do something... that also goes in Global. :)<BR><BR>This is my blip for Twilight:<BR>As Twilight is rated PG13, and there are players under 13, please keep Twilight chat in private chat, thanks. :)<BR><BR>I also will *poof* Twilight or Harry Potter or whatever the topic is that is not appreciated in global into Private Chat.  Or at least out of public chat.<BR><BR>If the entire server seems to be having fun with Harry Potter, and the content does stay appropriate, then it can be in global, for a bit anyway... But only for 5 or perhaps 10 minutes especially if there is a high player count.  Since not all players wish to discuss Harry Potter...<BR><BR>If possible, try to play them into a non public chat, with poofing, or tickling, or something... *laughing out loud!* Helps keep down the fights. :S<BR><BR>If you have any questions about something that is not covered here, please post and ask! :)  <BR><BR>We kind of need to all be on the same page, regardless of server. :)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Dec 23 2009 9:40am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I thought of a few more things to add *laughing out loud!*<BR><BR>Celebrity chat also should really go into non-public chat as again, some hate that celebrity, some love them... there goes the fighting.  They may chat all they want to as long as it's not in public chat. *laughing out loud!*<BR><BR>We used to be able to have some of that type of chat in global, but any more too many players whose sole purpose is to disagree with something, end up starting server wide fights.  <BR><BR>No sad topics, no death topics, no serious injury, no hate speak, no date speak... <BR><BR>Since this is Christmas time... Santa is allowed, (well he is up there on Christmas isle after all *laughing out loud!* )  however, players may not trash Santa, there are young children that play.   My blib: Santa is quite real, he is on Christmas Isle. :)   Then a pm to the player requesting them to keep negative comments out of public chat, that young children play here, please respect this.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by NightMare)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Dec 23 2009 9:41am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>You explain things so well, thanks!</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by LadyCourage)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Dec 23 2009 10:06am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Yes DP, thank you!

As long as the content is ok for the game, and it's not bothering anyone, it's basically ok.  However, if for example with Twilight, they get into biting, or who is the hottest, Jacob or Edward, then that's violence, dating. <BR><BR>The same with Harry Potter, if it's not bothering anyone, it's ok, but only if it doesn't go on too long or totally flood global. The first post I see where someone says, &quot;Oh not again!&quot;  Or something like that, then the chat needs to clear out of global.  They may chat all they like in chat here, buddy or pm.  So it's not like we are denying them their chat, just moving it to another channel so it doesn't become harassing.<BR><BR>It's not really fair for others to have to mute global because of the content, since global is for all the server players.<BR><BR>Chestnut (I think...) had a nice global chat about Harry Potter the other night, lasted probably 5 or 6 minutes, then since other players were trying to ask for quest help, and it was being scrolled off the screen, I just asked the players to take Harry Potter to private chat please as it was sort of flooding global. They didn't have any problems with that. <BR><BR>Violence that is more than marshmallow or tomato throwing really shouldn't be on the game where the young children can see it.  Neither should vampire topics, or dating.  So, as long as they aren't breaking the rules, it's ok. :)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Unjust)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Dec 27 2009 6:48pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Yes that is what I was refering too as there has been a number of times now I have been online when the players have had really good nice conversations on these topics and it has never gone badly.  But if we don't give them the chance to show they can do the correct thing then how will they ever learn, surely the benifit of the doubt has to apply rather than jumping on them the moment they mention any of these topics.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Dec 29 2009 8:04pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Players may ask for others to join in competitions in global chat if they wish, however they may only ask once ever 5 minutes if it's in global. If they wish to ask more often, then it needs to go into ads chat. Otherwise it's spamming. :)   <BR><BR>They may also have their releasing parties if they wish, they just may not advertise them.  So, if they keep advertising after being asked to not do so, you can mute them for 5 minutes, then 10 if they still continue.  It's not against the rules to release a horse, or have a releasing party.  It's a pain for those who whisper the released horses, yes... but it's still not against the rules. *laughing out loud!*</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Dec 31 2009 7:04pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Please remember not to criticize a player for how much they are selling something for.

Now due to the large amount of players coming and going so fast I kept posting the boarding warning which then (Bangs head) caused drama cause the player got up in arms over the other players being warned of the risks of boarding.  I just wish boarding could be banned it would save so many problems of stolen animals etc. etc.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Unjust)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jan 3 2010 8:33pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Ok it seems that on cremello i have been told many times now by players that they are allowed to be saying in global that they have killed SJ  cause i get the whole but it is common to say it etc. etc. and they don't like me not letting them say it.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jan 3 2010 9:06pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Boarding would be just about impossible to ban, as there really isn't any way to prevent it.  Sort of like with role playing.  There really isn't any way to prevent it.  We just hope to keep it nice.  The same way with boarding, if they choose to take the risk then it's up to them.  Many players and moderators board horses for others without any problems.  Only some cheat, or are caught with someone being banned and boarding a horse.  As long as the players are reminded once in a while that they might lose the horse, there really isn't anything else we can do.  <BR><BR>I don't really like the killed part, but as it's not direct violence against a person or animal I sort of ignore it.  *laughing out loud!*  Basically they are just saying they did fantastic at sj.   So the overall context is ok. *laughing out loud!*</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Unjust)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jan 3 2010 11:33pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Any topics surrounding the death matter are not appropriate for Global so please drop it. <BR><BR>So I am guessing that Killing showjumping no matter what they actually mean doesn't fit into this which sorry seems they could say any word means anything pretty much sorry to sound difficult.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by FrogLips)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jun 13 2011 4:26pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Thought I'd use just this preexisting threat..<BR>I know noob in any form isn't allowed.. o or zeros.. and newbie is allowed..
