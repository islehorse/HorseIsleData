She said it's continuing over onto social media as well with this player picking on the players who she's bullying in game. Apparently it is on a horse isle page, but I did tell her that there are a lot of unofficial social media pages, that are not linked to Horseisle, and there wasn't anything we could do about them really. I said the best way to tackle any rule breaking was for players to report any bullying or use the mute button, but I said I'd mention it anyway. She was really adamant that she didn't want people in game to know she'd complained, but I said it wouldn't go any further than here. I just thought I'd mention it, I don't know if there's any way you can check up on her chats, but hopefully one day player will make use of that handy mute button.

I told her to report the chat, she said it happened about an hour ago (game time right now is 8.32am) and she had logged out inbetween. I told her to report it anyway, and I'd let you know that I told her to file it incase the report is no good. I wasn't sure if it would work as she's been logged out, and it's over an hour ago. Hope this was ok! :)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Feb 3 2017 5:01pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I'll look into it a bit later.

It was a polite request.  Ancrath is free to mute Cat or remove buddies, or whatever.<BR><BR>Players are welcome to file abuse reports if they feel they are being bullied, however it needs to be at that time if possible.<BR><BR>I did go back all the way to Sunday for the chat content, and no sign of bulling.  If it's happening it was either a while back or off game.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Elanor)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Feb 11 2017 1:17pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>OK!
