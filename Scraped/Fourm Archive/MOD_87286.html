This often messes with the coding for the game and makes it so sometimes the save button disappears. This prevents you from being able to change that horse's information and forces me to go in and erase the name and description.<BR>Sorry it doesn't work with it. &quot;<BR><BR>So, if you already have something, and nothing is glitching fine, you may keep it. However please do Not add more, or use the other fonts in profiles and horse names. :)<BR><BR>Lets not use the special fonts at all for profiles and horse names please.<BR><BR>Again, if you already have it and it's working you may keep it.<BR><BR>There was basically the same post here in our forum without the added bit of it they already have them and they work they may keep them..  hope this helps :)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Continuum)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Aug 25 2011 11:50am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>So how do we know if it's new or not?</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by FrogLips)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Aug 25 2011 3:00pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I don't think there is a way to truly know if it's new or not. but if they are trying to use the wii fonts and break the game Miranda sure will know when she had to go and fix it..<BR>I suppose kids will be kids and if they think they can get away with it they will try it.. =/</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by FrogLips)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Aug 29 2011 7:04am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Okay.. new question.. Sorry..<BR>Players are now asking if it's only the wii font or does this also include the other playstation like fonts? Some are now saying it only says wii, I have a playstation or xbox?  <BR>I have been telling players that it's all special fonts that aren't part of the game, that game consoles are using different coding and can still mess up the game and please don't use them.<BR>Ruling, advice, etc    Thank you much!!</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Aug 29 2011 10:08am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>All &quot;other&quot; fonts.  <BR><BR>Use this given game font or break the profile basically.  While there are a few of the characters that don't seem to break it, that might just be lucky... So No more special fonts regardless of what they are.  Those that do have them may keep them, however they do risk it locking up at any given time so they really should get rid of them.<BR><BR>As to how it will be handled if they continue to use the fonts... I have no idea.  Several options from fixing profile after profile (includes horse names) and delaying updates and other game work to assigning violations to just leaving them broken and keeping the player from altering it at all. <BR><BR>I don't know which of those Miranda will choose.  Personally I opt for the last one... perhaps that will make a large enough impression... they won't risk it. *laughing out loud!* Since they would not be able to alter their profile or their horses profile or name.<BR><BR>Possible down side to that however is, especially if it's there personal profile, that they would create a multiple account because their original account's profile was broken.  -_-<BR><BR>So, no idea what will be done if they keep using the fonts, but it is against the rules to use them.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Miranda)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Sep 7 2011 12:08pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Honestly, don't worry about 'enforcing' this.  The note is so players realize that using those fonts can often break the profile.  I definitely don't expect mods to make a big deal out of it, and I actually don't want them to.  As mods, ignore it completely.  If a player complains about a horse's save button missing, mention that it's because they used Wii fonts (most likely) and to email support so I can delete the name/description.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by ThisMagicMoment)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Sep 12 2011 8:22am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Ok great, thanks for clearing this up! :)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR></TABLE><HR><FORM METHOD=POST>Add a reply to this topic:<BR><TABLE><TR><TD><TEXTAREA NAME=TEXT ROWS=4 COLS=60></TEXTAREA></TD><TD><INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE='ADD REPLY'></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=SUBJECT VALUE='NOT NEEDED'><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=FORUM VALUE='GAME'><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=VIEWID VALUE='87286'></FORM>[ <A HREF='?FORUM=GAME'>GO BACK TO GAME FORUM</A> ]<BR><BR><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 WIDTH=100%>
