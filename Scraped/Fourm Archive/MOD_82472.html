It often causes more problems than it helps.  In this case, it actually worked out to help everything, but I believe it only did because she took the time to chat with the player quite a bit.<BR><BR>Take notice of how this started.  ChaosGypsy was having a lot of problems with this player and the player did not like her at all.  It ended with her actually asking to be buddies. :)<BR><BR>C-Feb20 18:28:29 ChaosGypsy(G): No Personal Info<BR>C-Feb20 18:28:35 ChaosGypsy(G): you know the rules<BR>C-Feb20 18:28:44 ChaosGypsy(G): DONT push them -.-<BR>C-Feb20 18:28:57 Player($): shut it Chaos<BR>I-Feb20 18:29:05 Player Player Has clicked QUIT button<BR>SER-Feb20 18:52:05pm Player Successfully Logged In. <BR>ADM-Feb20 18:57:39 ADMIN (ChaosGypsy) COMMAND: [MUTE Player 60 ]<BR>C-Feb20 18:59:52 ChaosGypsy(P): Player|your muted 60 min for causing drama in global and for dodging a mute next time stay out of things that do not concern you<BR>C-Feb20 19:00:43 Player(P): ChaosGypsy|im not affraid u know<BR>C-Feb20 19:01:11 ChaosGypsy(P): Player|i did not mute you to scare you<BR>C-Feb20 19:01:38 Player(P): ChaosGypsy|im not scared to soeak my mind either<BR>C-Feb20 19:01:42 ChaosGypsy(P): Player|i muted you because you dodges a mute for causing drama in global chats and for being rude in global chats<BR>C-Feb20 19:01:56 Player(P): ChaosGypsy|but its my opinion<BR>C-Feb20 19:01:59 ChaosGypsy(P): Player|there are rules everyone on hi has to follow<BR>C-Feb20 19:02:28 ChaosGypsy(P): Player|yes  thats fine but you cannot speak them like that you must follow the same rules as everyuone else<BR>C-Feb20 19:02:49 ChaosGypsy(P): Player|the entire game has to follow rules<BR>C-Feb20 19:03:03 Player(P): ChaosGypsy|yes and isnt one being nice to others?

I think a lot of players simply want to chat with someone when they're upset about... anything, really.  Maybe at that moment, their life is in chaos (no pun intended) and need someone to just listen.  I've drawn players into PM chat before, when they say something inflammatory in global, because they just need someone to listen.  And I'm usually pretty good at listening. = )  <BR><BR>I also think players appreciate when mods... Pull back the curtain, so to speak. Let them understand what mods do, and how we think.  I think we (mods) *all* want HI to be a safe, fun experience for *everyone* and players don't always see that bigger picture.  <BR><BR>Again, well done. And thanks Miranda and Chaos for sharing = )</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Naginata)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Feb 21 2011 9:14am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Great job, Chaos! =)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by OrbWeaver)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Feb 21 2011 10:29am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Well done, Romi!</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by ChaosGypsy)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Feb 21 2011 3:01pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>thanks Guys... I just figure the kids today that are on the net pretty much 24/7 or everyday after school and after dinner and such ate what a decade ago were called the Latch key kids... they are now the &quot;keyboard Kids&quot;... they just need to know someones out there and that they are safe... and HI needs to be that &quot;safe place&quot; and we are those people that are out there for them when they are stuck at home waiting for parents to get off work and putting up with older siblings that are *babysitting* *laughing out loud!*  99% of the time I find this is the major issue *laughing out loud!* so I rain them in and listen and let them know hey someones out there and we care even if its caring enough to say NO yo cannot do that you too have to behave... sometimes that means even more... I knwo to my own herd of kids that meant even more to them growing up  *laughing out loud!* that I took the time to tell then WHOA there is no way thats gonna fly in my house... these kids are not that different from my own *laughing out loud!* just a bit further away but just as dear to me and yes they do at times make my hair go just a grey *laughing out loud!*</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by FrogLips)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Feb 21 2011 7:32pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Very nice Chaos.. and I totally relate and agree with the keyboard kids..
