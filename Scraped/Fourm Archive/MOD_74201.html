If you happen to see it in buddy, then you can ask them to change subject *nods*  *laughing out loud!* But mostly important for global where everyone on the server can see. :)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Miranda)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 15 2010 1:25pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>A lot of the players think that buddy chat is free rein.  They can say whatever they want there.  They should realize that is not the case. <BR><BR>Talk to them and ask them to change the topic.  Please don't forget to report players that you see chatting inappropriate in buddy.  Some players remove people because of this.  They think they are tattle-tales, but of course they then complain that people get away with the breaking the rules when they get in trouble down the road.  So, as usual, we can't do something about what's not reported.<BR>A little off track, but it still basically fits.<BR><BR>As usual though, if you don't see it, you can't punish.  Ask the player that came to you to file an abuse report.  If you don't think they will, feel free to do so yourself as a precaution.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by LorienSunStar)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 15 2010 1:39pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Ok Miranda Ill keep an eye out for it now. May i ask this thing that is going round singing pants on the ground looking like a fool with your pants on the ground, do you guys think its ok? I have it said in buddy chat alot and i really dont like it but it is a song however even songs can be inappropriate, I just dont like it.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DarkFaerie)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 15 2010 1:49pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I think that would depend on the context of it and in which way they mean pants, they are under wear here in the UK and trousers over in the US. Its a bit rude either way.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 15 2010 2:07pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Pants need to stay on the player, not be on the ground regardless... :P  *laughing out loud!* <BR><BR>Then innuendo or referenced image of what are you wearing if your pants are on the ground is not really appropriate. :S<BR><BR>Unless they are saying they got a new pair or jeans or riding trousers or something, pants aren't really appropriate. :)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Miranda)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 16 2010 8:40am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I don't know if you guys know the reference for that song, but it's from a crazy older guy that sang it during his American Idol audition.<BR><BR>The point of the song is actually making fun of those 'kids' that walk around with their pants hanging way off their bum.  Many people think people that do this (sometimes the waist portion of the pants is halfway down their thighs or to their knees) look absolutely ridiculous.  It's an issue that's gotten to the point of some places trying to put a law in place that can give out tickets for showing any undergarments in public (due to pants being too low).<BR><BR>So, honestly, I have no problem with the song.  If it helps the kids to realize that wearing their pants hanging off their bum is not cool, but dumb, than I'm up for it.  I really don't think any of them are thinking of it in the inappropriate manner in which it would not be okay. :)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR></TABLE><HR><FORM METHOD=POST>Add a reply to this topic:<BR><TABLE><TR><TD><TEXTAREA NAME=TEXT ROWS=4 COLS=60></TEXTAREA></TD><TD><INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE='ADD REPLY'></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=SUBJECT VALUE='NOT NEEDED'><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=FORUM VALUE='GAME'><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=VIEWID VALUE='74201'></FORM>[ <A HREF='?FORUM=GAME'>GO BACK TO GAME FORUM</A> ]<BR><BR><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 WIDTH=100%>
