I made this forum post because I noticed that a lot of people claimed that making a profile is too hard because they don't understand the HTML and they want to stop their entire profile from being bold, underlined, or italicized, but when they try, it doesn't work. It's not that hard to make a profile, I promise. :-) I am making this so you can learn about matching colors your profile and not overusing italics or bolds.<BR>Before we begin, I want to make sure that this entire forum will make you an appropriate profile.<BR><BR>Detailed Rules:<BR>- Please do not include another language in any Profiles, including Horse and Player profiles, if another language is included in your profile, you will be notified and told to remove it, or it will be forcibly removed.<BR>- Gangs/herds/clans or anything similar are not allowed. This includes in profile descriptions.<BR>- A hate list can be as simple as having in a profile: &quot;I hate player1 since she didn't buy my horse.&quot;<BR>- If a hate group or list is found in a profile description, you will be asked to remove it or it will be forcibly removed.<BR>- All game rules apply to profiles.<BR>- Please do not add ANY of the above rule breaking Personal Information - you will be asked to remove it or it will be forcibly removed.<BR>- Please avoid controversial and religious topics or clubs within your profile.<BR>- Please ensure that ALL content in your profile is in the English language.<BR>- Please be aware of this when creating a profile. There is no need to have any religious references in a profile. This even includes mentioning what religion you are. There is no reason others need to know what religion you are.<BR><BR>Make sure that none of the profile you are making contains rule-breaking language.<BR>Let's start at the top of your profile. Where do you want your heading to be? Your heading can be your favorite quote, song lyric, or your username. Don't be boring. Use your favorite color instead of black. Don't forget to place [/i][/b] at the beginning of your profile to prevent unintended bold fonts and italicized fonts.<BR><BR>Example: <BR>[/i][/b][blue]                              Dapples<BR>This is an appropiate heading. Make sure if you decide to do multiple special effects that you close them properly.<BR><BR>Incorrect Example:<BR>[/i][/b][blue]                              [i][u]D[/i][/u]apples<BR><BR>Correct Example:<BR>[/i][/b][blue]                              [i][u]D[/u][/i]apples<BR>The underline was the most recent entered coding, so it is the first to be closed by the backslash. (/)<BR><BR>If you click SAVE PROFILE and afterward click STATS to preview this, it should be exactly the way you want it!<BR><BR>Let's move on to the body of your profile.<BR>Example:<BR>[blue][b]About me.[/b]<BR>[grey]Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! <BR>That's boring! The &quot;About me.&quot; is written in the common bold. Let's try to make it italicized and underlined AND bold! &quot;It won't work!&quot; Yes, it will. I'll show you how to close it correctly.<BR><BR>Example:<BR>[blue][b][u]A[/u][/b]b[i][u]o[/u][/i]ut m[i]e[/i][b].[/b]<BR>[grey]Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! <BR>Note that the HTML that is entered last is closed first.<BR>Examples:<BR>[u]Word[/u]<BR>That is closed correctly. Let's add [i] around the word.<BR>[i][u]Word[/u][/i]<BR>See how I added it around what was already added? This is how to &quot;lasso&quot; your underlines where you want them and keep them from leaking onto other parts of your profile.<BR>Don't forget to click SAVE PROFILE often and view it under STATS! It takes a lot of saving and previewing to make a good profile!<BR>For the heading, put something like [c] Dapples 2011 and you're good to go!<BR><BR>This is the complete code of what we just worked with.<BR><BR>[/i][/b][blue]                              [i][u]D[/u][/i]apples<BR>[blue][b][u]A[/u][/b]b[i][u]o[/u][/i]ut m[i]e[/i][b].[/b]<BR>[grey]Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! Write about yourself here! <BR>[c] Dapples 2011</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Flight)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jun 18 2011 3:57pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Love this, great forum post!<BR>Just wanted to say, you do not need to [/i] at the start of your player profile, you only need to [/b]. For horse profiles you only need to [/i] but not [/b]. The rest of it is perfect though :)<BR><BR>~DUN♥SERVER~</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by HiHiHi)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jun 22 2011 6:38am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Just a note because color can be annoying when coding with a lot of them, [/color] removes color <BR>As an example,  [blue]Hi[grey]Hi[green]Hi[/color] would make the text grey. If you added another, it would make it green, and another and it would be black.<BR> Why not just type [black] instead? Well from experience not ending your colour codes can end in the coding not coming out quite right.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Dal)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jun 22 2011 8:54pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Just a quick note: <BR>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is not allowed on HorseIsle.  These codes are placed inside of &lt; &gt; rather than [ ].  The code that is used on HorseIsle is called BBCode (Bulletin Board Code).  BBCode is the [b][i][u] etc.<BR><BR>For those interested, these are the codes we're allowed to use in profiles.<BR><BR>Bold: [b]<BR>Un-Bold: [/b]<BR>Italic: [i]<BR>Un-Italic: [/i]<BR>Underline: [u]<BR>Un-Underline: [/u]<BR>To change the colour: [colour]<BR><BR>Note: When using two or more of the bold, italic, or underline at once, you must close the tags in opposite order. [b][i] must be closed [/i][/b]<BR><BR>Note 2: Sometimes you will need to combine codes, for example [b][i][u][/u][/i][u][/u][/b].  Before you can close the italics, you must close the underline.  If you want to continue underlining, you can reopen the underline after closing the italic.  If there is not a space between the ][ then there will be a seamless underline.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jun 23 2011 11:05am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Excellent Dapples. :)  <BR><BR>Locking this.
