The point of a track record would be to see what pellets were used when they were used, and what changes they made. I feel that if that was the purpose, then it does not really serve that purpose and thus makes it pointless.<BR><BR>From some of the news recently, it seems like erasing the residue counter would be an easier fix than re-coding an entirely new pellet and trying to implement it in the game.<BR><BR>Thank you for taking the time to read, and I hope to hear everyone's opinion. <BR><BR>Smaug - Pinto/Chestnut</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Gho)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>May 25 2020 7:27am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I'm kind of on the fence on it.<BR><BR>I like the res counter because like it's intention - it is there for us to see if the horse has a track record. Which is useful because honestly, some of us like seeing the horse having a lot of res to remind us how much money we've spent trying to make the horse what we want it to be. Would be nice to keep that. <BR><BR>On the other hand, I think removing the res counter would help the economy. Some people looking to buy horses don't like seeing the res. Erasing the counter completely would make it easier for everyone to buy horses because, well, there is no res. Though, I honestly don't know how many people look at the res counter before purchase. I do have some buds who do so.<BR><BR>Just some thoughts on it. I don't know if I'm for or against it at this point in time.<BR><BR>Gho - Pinto/Chestnut</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Cyndaquil)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>May 25 2020 7:34am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I'm one of those players who always buys things with the consideration of res, not because I don't want to colour/height things because my buds know that i'm all for pelleting, but i just don't like seeing the counter there so generally try to buy 'natural horses'.<BR><BR>So I know i'd be quite happy if the residue counter was removed, because i'd start actually colouring and pelleting things again, and buying a lot more horses because I could colour and height them to the horse that I want rather than thinking 'if i colour/height' it'll potentially lower the value of the horse' for those who do consider res, like myself and i'll no longer be annoyed by the counter numbers.<BR><BR>Cyndaquil - Cremello/Pinto</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Ash)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>May 25 2020 7:46am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>100% agree.

There are not a lot of players who can afford pellets, so it is unfair if someone is able to pellet their horse into &quot;perfect height and stats&quot; and then sell it for a much higher price than the player with no money who caught it wild but with a &quot;little less than perfect stats.&quot;<BR><BR>Pellets are great and I think it's a good thing to have them for the players who want to use them and can afford to do so. I just think that the magic residue counter keeps things a bit more even between players of different levels of wealth. Otherwise the wealthy players will have a monopoly on the top horses. <BR><BR>I get it, life isn't fair! But the magic residue counter keeps things fair on the game. Players have a right to know if the horse is truly special enough it was caught that way instead of created that way with a lot of money.<BR><BR>It is difficult to sell horses right now because so many people are whispering (I admit I am guilty of this), so I think that is why the magic residue topic is coming back up.

So the only reason I could think anyone who uses pellets would care is so you can sell horses without consequence of pelleting... which to me means don't pellet horses you might end up selling.<BR><BR>I don't know, this is a pesonal no from me.<BR><BR>Mrs - Pinto</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Willow)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>May 25 2020 8:04am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Interesting point Wanderlust, but each pellet cost 250m, So if you earn that money and make the horse &quot;perfect&quot; then you earned it. And even if it does sell for more then it was originally worth, you're going to end up losing a lot of money in the process. So even for richer players it isn't really a win at that point it was a mistake *laughing out loud!* (if you end up selling it).<BR><BR>This would be harder then just removing the res counters, but i think adding a new tab next to profile, thats a history tab and it could actually show the changes, could be a more aesthetic way of doing it and also actually give insight to the changes, like on hi2. I don't know if that would help or just keep the issue the same though. So that is iffy.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Fascination)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>May 25 2020 8:37am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Although I have residue that I regret, I still don't think it justifies the removal of the residue counter. <BR><BR>Here are a few of my thoughts on the matter: <BR>1) In a game with a lot of dishonesty, I think the residue counter should remain to ensure transparency between players. <BR>2) The game has adjusted - the lack of residue has become a value point for some similar to height and UTs. <BR>3) Although some believe the counter lowers the value of the horse, we have to look at it from the other side as well. If the counter was removed, &quot;natural&quot; horses would be the ones experiencing the decrease in value. This would be due to losing the value point mentioned in #2.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Smaug)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>May 25 2020 8:48am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I like all the differing opinions. I know an idea brought up was having an extra tab &quot;History&quot; of sorts on the horse like HI2. Although, I do not think it could be implemented in a way where it would be able to trace the ones already applied which would sadly be a downfall. A running log if you will.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>May 25 2020 1:05pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>The residue counter is there so players know that a horse has been modified.  While many players don't much care, there are also quite a few players for whom this is important.  They want a horse that is &quot;natural&quot; not one that has been modified from what it originally was.  <BR><BR>There was originally a big uproar over not knowing if a horse was &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;unnatural&quot; thus the counter. <BR><BR>It's something that really needs to remain unless we remove the ability to modify the horse.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR></TABLE><HR><FORM METHOD=POST>Add a reply to this topic:<BR><TABLE><TR><TD><TEXTAREA NAME=TEXT ROWS=4 COLS=60></TEXTAREA></TD><TD><INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE='ADD REPLY'></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=SUBJECT VALUE='NOT NEEDED'><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=FORUM VALUE='GAME'><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=VIEWID VALUE='98435'></FORM>[ <A HREF='?FORUM=GAME'>GO BACK TO GAME FORUM</A> ]<BR><BR><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 WIDTH=100%>
