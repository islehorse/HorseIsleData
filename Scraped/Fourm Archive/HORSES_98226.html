On pinto, people are excessively whispering so much which means there are more horses in circulation, but the number of players isn't keeping up.

I don't think it's very &quot;helpful&quot; to even know how much residue it has anyway.

That would be perfect. I personally would buy more horses knowing that I could pellet the gender to whichever I wanted. Then not only would I be buying more horses, I would also be spending money on the pellet as well. Also, pellets are very, very expensive. I don't know if making them more affordable would be helpful in any way.

Residue is fine. I'm almost happy seeing it. If someone is willing to pellet a horse it shows to me that people are willing to spend stupid amount of dolla on something at the risk of devaluing it, so they clearly valued the pixels on a personal level. For this reason I almost prefer things with residue, although I know I'm the minority. <BR><BR>2. So what if it changes horse values? It's another thing to be chosey on. If people want something to be 'clean' and are willing to pay more for it then that's fine for them, it's not a problem. Yes, boo for you, you can't sell your pony for as much as someone else who has one without residue, but it's supply and demand, that's how the world works. <BR><BR>3. I really don't think height pellets are a problem. They cost more than the added value of a horse when its maxhh so it's not economically viable to pellet for the sake of increasing a horses value.<BR><BR>4. Gender pellet is cute, sure why not, pop it in the res count though for above reasons.<BR><BR>That's all folks.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Cobber)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Feb 28 2018 8:57am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I agree with Hedwig's list apart from maybe all pellets should be priced differently? For example, height pellets should be more than colour pellets and then we'll have an even bigger money sink?<BR>So my list would be - <BR> <BR>Keep all pellets but hide the residue from the horse's profile. (maybe it can be a player stat, under player exp on a profile it could say horse's pelleted and the amount?<BR><BR>Add a gender pellet<BR><BR>Does that work for everyone?</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Cobber)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Feb 28 2018 8:58am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Oh and increase the cost of height / decrease the cost of colour pellet</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Jedi)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Feb 28 2018 9:01am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Pellets are a great thing, considering po's are so unreliable, height and color pellets give us another way to &quot;po&quot; a horse. However, the counter in the profile is not a great thing, because people treat it like a disease and consider the horse to be worthless even if it only has 1 magic residue on it. It hurts the economy because horses with residue don't sell for their worth. So I agree with keeping pellets, but just getting rid of the counters.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Jedi)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Feb 28 2018 9:09am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I disagree with pellet prices changing as well (unless the developers want to put the economy back to how it used to be *laughing out loud!*)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Lioness)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Mar 4 2018 5:53pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I like residue, coming from a player who was around before there were &quot;easy way outs&quot; and was against UT (UNTRAINABLE, remember?) pellets from the start. Height pellets came after, and I still can't get behind either. So yes, if there is a record saying how much the horse has been artificially altered, the better.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Misfortune)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Mar 4 2018 11:51pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I feel like the counter just ruins all the work they put into jacking up the economy. It's much harder to make money, and nice horses sell for a ton. think the whole idea was that we would run ourselves out of billions by pelleting or something and therefore prices would lower, but the counter just makes people less likely to pellet. so there's still a ton of money in the game, held by a few people, and they aren't going to give it up to pellet something if it will just reduce the value because the res counter. so horse prices are made up and the economy is a mess (pawn food or 500m+ there is hardly an in between). but maybe i'm still just unhappy about the econ changes with no notice *laughing out loud!*...</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by CookieDough)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Mar 20 2018 8:34pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>It would be great to have the counter removed. All it seems to do is devalue horses</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Mar 21 2018 12:27pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>The counter is there because players asked for it.  They wanted to know whether the horse was &quot;natural&quot; or not.  That is a valid issue, so I imagine the counter will stay. <BR><BR>Basically the pellets are for you to use on your horses if you wish to up something or change something.  Should you choose to sell the horse, then the buyer has a right to know if the horse has been altered in any way.  They buyer may then buy or not as they wish.<BR><BR>As the owners are currently working on seeing if they are going to do a HI3 or something... I doubt Joe and Miranda will get involved in removing something that players asked for.  <BR><BR>If so, they possibly would just remove the pellets, that would be easier probably to do.  <BR><BR>Having all horses for sale that have max height, max stats, etc.  Messes up the &quot;pool&quot; of horses.  It was put in for players to basically use personally.  <BR><BR>And again, the buyer has a right to know if the horse originally came that way or if it was altered.  An altered horse should sell for less since it's not &quot;natural.&quot;  It's been altered.  This allows for those rare horses that do come out max whatever to be special.  <BR><BR>Otherwise no horses are special.  It would end up with all horses for sale being max height.  So no one would then care if the horse was max height.  And for those who don't want max height, too bad.<BR><BR>I think it's best basically to leave it as it is. :)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR></TABLE><HR><B>THIS THREAD IS CURRENTLY LOCKED, NO NEW POSTS AT THIS TIME.</B><HR>[ <A HREF='?FORUM=GAME'>GO BACK TO GAME FORUM</A> ]<BR><BR><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 WIDTH=100%>
