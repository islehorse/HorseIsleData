All ranches unowned, no player profiles whatsoever, completely fresh experience/horse lists, reset economy to be based only off of quest rewards/pawneer prices... I think that would offer a decent compromise for those players, like myself, who'd like to be a little more competitive insofar as experience training goes, without feeling discouraged by the 100k+ tops on almost a dozen breeds, with nearly three times as many over 50k, iirc. <BR><BR>I liked 2, and I'll probably still play it off and on, but I can't get the hang of 3, not as a casual game the way that I've always played Horse Isle, and I don't have a computer that will run 3 at any decent, half-way enjoyable rate, so I'd really like to see HI1 survive, even if that means it goes down for a while to be upgraded/revamped. So, what are everyone else's thoughts as to what they'd like to see/need to see in order to keep playing/come back if/when HI1 is taken down?</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by WildHorseRunning)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 12 2020 1:47pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>After speaking with some buds, the suggestion was brought up that if one of the servers is 'reset', could those who still keep their accounts alive there for whatever reason be given an opportunity to 'convert' to another server? Maybe another of the inactive ones, if they don't use those horses/etc. <BR><BR>Speaking with my mother, who's modded/admined for a lot of forum-based websites, the server space for those can get really expensive, and for something like a game, it likely needs dedicated server space, which is even *more* expensive - and HI1 has 11 servers, so 11 different copies of the game that need to run simultaneously and keep track of their individual data. With that in mind, it's not surprising to me that HI1 has been losing money recently, after the dip in activity - and financially, it doesn't make sense(to me at least) to try to bring HI1 back with the same amount of servers(and thus cost) if only one or two are being used. If the server capacity is 150 players on at a time, it would make more sense money-wise to keep the current most active server as-is, and bringing one back as a fresh start, and potentially add in more if HI1 gets popular again. <BR><BR>I recognize that even on these inactive servers, that only ever seem to have 1 or 2 players on, if that, there are still people who keep their accounts active/horses alive for whatever reason, and it wouldn't exactly be *fair* to them to just... wipe their accounts without warning. But if HI1 is already going down for a revamp, will the current server info be able to be saved and re-implemented into its new form(assuming it does come back and doesn't stay down)? Could those players' horses/accounts be transferred to another server, maybe after contact is established by admin/mod and they're asked about their plans regarding HI1?</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Lioness)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 12 2020 3:32pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>If the game is brought back, then I feel like the best pathway forward is to have one server since it will be a smaller customer base, with the easiest option leaving Pinto as is since it has largely become the default for most players (or another total reset but that does not appeal to someone who has already made the leap from a dead server once). Active players will inevitably flock to one server with so few on. Black, when it was created, was toted to be a fresh start for existing players to enjoy sans interest, but it has fallen to the wayside after time. I believe they have ruled out combining servers since it would have to be done practically one by one.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by WildHorseRunning)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 12 2020 3:41pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>That's what I was thinking, that combining servers would be a lot of effort? Obviously I'm not a mod/admin/coder, so I don't know the extent of what that would take, but given when the game was originally created/what I've gleaned over the years as far as moderator/admin abilities, it seems like it would be too much effort for too little satisfaction to try to merge servers.<BR><BR>Possibly getting in touch with players who still have accounts on those dead servers, maybe asking them to select their top 5(to pick a small random number) horses to transfer to a new account in the 'preserved' server or the reset one(if they decide to have more than one), along with their subscription(if they have one)/bank amount/*possibly* quest points could be an option? It would limit the amount of horses that would need to be transferred over, eliminate items, and minimize the work needed. I know from Palomino server in particular, there's only 10 players on the Top Horse Exp list in City Hall, and only 8 ranches owned - including my own, but I did that more to fulfill 13-year-old me's dream of owning a ranch by the whisperer *laughing out loud!* But in all 7 of the ranches that actually exist from long-term players, the horses have stat-decayed to the maximum. So even though the subscription is still active, the players are not, at least not on that server(and I only remember seeing 1 of the player names ever active on Pinto).</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by StraitPirate)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 14 2020 7:58am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Ahhh as much as it would stink I'd be happy even if they just reset everything and started new with like 2 or 3 servers or something instead. It would reset the economy too, it's super inflated from what it originally was.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by WildHorseRunning)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 14 2020 8:11am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>A lot of people would be really upset with that, which is why I suggested keeping Pinto, since it's the one most active/that people have put the most time into the past few years. But personally, I probably would play more on a fresh server than I would on Pinto, if they brought the game back with Pinto + 1 reset server, because I'd love to just... Experience the game all over again. And yeah, the economy being a bit inflated is kind of a bummer *laughing out loud!* Even though it's relaxed now that HI1 is EOL, it's still pretty inflated</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 14 2020 12:47pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>What is on one server is on all servers.  They are all tied to the programming, just separate from each other.  <BR><BR>However we do not have the ability to move anything (other than a sub) from one server to another server, the game was not programmed to be able to do that.  <BR><BR>Things can go from Beta to the live servers but that's it. <BR><BR>Servers can't be combined as they are in different locations technically.  They are totally separate from each other.<BR><BR>  No idea if Joe will spend the massive amount of time to re-program HI1's security.  That's something that we will have to wait and see on.<BR><BR>It's extremely time consuming and takes him completely away from HI3 where he is needed.  So honestly I have no idea.  <BR><BR>Hopefully he will assuming Flash is still accessible come 2021, however it would still be a while somewhere between 1 and 3 months of programming... That is a lot, and he is again needed on HI3.  <BR><BR>We will have to wait and see.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by StraitPirate)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 15 2020 11:49am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Ohhh I hope Joe's feeling generous *laughing out loud!* HorseIsle's meant so much to so many people over the years. <BR>Even if he does decide to redo it, where it'll take so much time to work on, it'll probably be a lot longer before we're up and running again yeah? Like I know you said it could take 1-3 months, but I mean if its 1-3 months of work and he's just fitting it in where he can it could be quite a while eh?<BR><BR>I know I keep saying it but ooooh I hope we get er back</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Lavinium)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 27 2020 1:13pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I hope someday Horse Isle will make its return. It's a game that has meant incredibly much to me and one of the places that has always felt like home, no matter my age, no matter where I am or what's going on in my life. I'm sure many others feel the same. It would be incredible to have this wonderful game preserved somehow so that we can all enjoy it for years to come. I know it's a lot of work, but I hope someday it can be done.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by McHorses)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Dec 25 2020 1:09pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I would love to keep playing!
