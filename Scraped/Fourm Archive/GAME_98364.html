The admins are the ones who decide when Beta is open for registration. It's your responsibility to check the HI3 website from now on. :)<BR><BR>Good luck,<BR><BR>Pathfinder</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Pathfinder)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Mar 31 2019 2:43pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>For all of those who want to know more about what the breeds in HI3 look like - you can now do that.

I check the website every day but I'm not in the USA so always seem to be sleeping when they happen. If an email was sent out I'd wake with the notification.

My only advice would be to make the HI3 page your 'start up page' kinda thing, so it's the first thing you'll see when you open Chrome/Firefox etc, that's how I got in. Just keep checking back :D</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertWind)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 30 2019 12:54pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Email's are not being sent out at this time.  The notifications are for major updates and probably won't begin until open Beta.  Even then, they will be rare.  Horse Isle will not be spamming people with mail.  You can check the HI3 web page for what's happening if you wish that info. :)<BR><BR>Jor is getting ready for open Beta at this time.  I don't know if announcements will go out at that time or not since it's not really important who joins first... It will be open Beta.  Sign up when you get to it.  And again, you can check the HI3 page if you want to know if it's open yet or not.<BR><BR>The game will probably not go live for some time yet, there is still a Lot of work to be done.  <BR><BR>Request:  Please remember Beta is for testing.  It's not a way to play the game early.  It's to test this here and that there, to see if it breaks, to see if it is buggy, etc.  <BR><BR>Beta may be completely wiped off and on so whatever you have done will be lost.  Again, it's for testing not playing.  You play as you test obviously, but only in some areas, many things won't be working.  The game will be down off and on, sometimes for quite a while.  There will be re-boots frequently.  <BR><BR>Once the game does go live nothing will be moved from Beta over to the regular game, and Beta will most likely be completely wiped.  Meaning everything will be lost/gone.<BR><BR>Do not expect things to always work properly.  This is the whole point of Beta, to find out what doesn't work when and then fix it.  Much of the content isn't in yet.  There is still a Lot of work to do before the game is in any shape to go live. :)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR></TABLE><HR><FORM METHOD=POST>Add a reply to this topic:<BR><TABLE><TR><TD><TEXTAREA NAME=TEXT ROWS=4 COLS=60></TEXTAREA></TD><TD><INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE='ADD REPLY'></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=SUBJECT VALUE='NOT NEEDED'><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=FORUM VALUE='GAME'><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=VIEWID VALUE='98364'></FORM>[ <A HREF='?FORUM=GAME'>GO BACK TO GAME FORUM</A> ]<BR><BR><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 WIDTH=100%>
