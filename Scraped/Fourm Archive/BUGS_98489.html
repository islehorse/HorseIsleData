Don't worry about the time it takes.<BR><BR>I have followed the workaround and got it working just fine. I have the game loading in the flash projector.<BR><BR>I have checked and made sure that both name and password are typed correctly, and in the right case. But I'm still getting the same error.<BR><BR>Everything else works on the login screen as far as I can tell (Cycling through tips, opening the menu, changing the background music, the animations in the background)So I assume it's loading just fine in the flash projector. <BR><BR><BR><BR></FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Syrup)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>May 10 2021 8:07am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I got it working by some more trial and error. I didn't see mention of this step, so it might be worth mentioning on some of the workaround information?<BR><BR>I actually had to attempt to access it through the server list on the website first. It seems like some step of this process is what creates a profile on a server. It's a bit hard to explain, but once there's a profile, I can log in. If the server has &quot;no existing profile&quot;, then I can't.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>May 10 2021 9:29am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>It shouldn't matter as long as you use the correct server address.<BR><BR>Each server has their own unique address.  <BR><BR>If you are on a Mac though sometimes they are fussy regarding the projector.  Some players don't have any issues, others do.  We can't track it down, it's apparently something with the Mac, some setting or the OS...?</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Syrup)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>May 11 2021 12:29am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I am on windows, so it should not be an OS issue.<BR><BR>Is there somewhere I can send a video/series of images explaining the issue?

Make sure you download the Projector.  Not the debugger.  <BR><BR>  Then you can place that file wherever you want, I have a shortcut on my desktop.<BR><BR>  Then, click on that and open up a blank white page.   Click on File on that page, then on Open.<BR><BR>  For Mac's it doesn't always come up with a white page.  Try hitting<BR>File and then Open Location then paste the link. :)<BR><BR>  That brings up the little window where you copy/paste the link that you want from the list for #6, the servers.<BR><BR>  For example, for pinto what you would copy/paste is the HI1 Pinto link.  For HI2 Eternal you would copy/paste that link etc...<BR><BR>For pinto server copy/paste the link on that page for Pinto. <BR><BR>  That will bring up that server and you type in your username (make sure you spell it just as it actually is, this system is case sensitive. And, give your password, again it's case sensitive so be sure to use caps when appropriate.)<BR><BR>  Then hit your enter key or click on the Enter button and there you go. :)   <BR><BR><BR></FORUMTEXT></TD></TR></TABLE><HR><FORM METHOD=POST>Add a reply to this topic:<BR><TABLE><TR><TD><TEXTAREA NAME=TEXT ROWS=4 COLS=60></TEXTAREA></TD><TD><INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE='ADD REPLY'></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=SUBJECT VALUE='NOT NEEDED'><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=FORUM VALUE='GAME'><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=VIEWID VALUE='98489'></FORM>[ <A HREF='?FORUM=GAME'>GO BACK TO GAME FORUM</A> ]<BR><BR><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 WIDTH=100%>
