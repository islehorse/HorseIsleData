What happens is it breaks the profile or name.  That means you can't change the profile at all, the save button doesn't work.  You can't change the horse name as the save button doesn't work.<BR><BR>Now, if this happens, you have to email support.  When...Miranda gets free time, she will go in and delete the entire profile (necessary as all it shows her is a bunch of garbage characters she has no idea what is what, so all of it has to be deleted.)  Same for the horse name, it too has to be deleted.<BR><BR>Miranda is a very busy lady, this is not top priority as you don't  have to use fonts that don't work with the game. So...it could take anywhere from quit soon to several days for her to get to it.  Just depends on her schedule.<BR><BR>We ask, that you not use these fonts and break your profiles please.  It's not a rule however, if you want to wait for a while with a totally broken profile, it's up to you.  <BR><BR>Also please keep then to a minimum in chat.  If you want to use them for a fancy ad, please try to keep it to just the first character or something.  For most of us the special fonts are very difficult to read.  Thus when you use them in your ad, you may find most players ignore your ad since they can't read it.  You limit your buyers as for the most part, only those who are familiar with the fonts can easily read them. <BR><BR>We also rather consider sentences with mostly Wii fonts to be spam, and a moderator in this instance will ask you to stop and use regular letters.  Mod's get enough headaches without trying to translate Wii fonts. *laughing out loud!*  :)<BR><BR>Thankies<BR>DP</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by NightMare)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 2 2013 11:14pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>REPLY: (by DesertPaint) Mar 21 2013 4:35pm<BR>It is not against the rules to use these.<BR><BR>However:<BR><BR>Since the game does not support those fonts, you may end up with a broken profile or horse name. Miranda will fix it however to do this she will have to delete ALL of the profile.<BR><BR>It's also not high up on her to do list so it might take several days before she gets to it.<BR><BR>If you want to take the risk (and it is a pretty high risk as some of the letters Will break the save button) and lose all of your profile and wait for possibly several days for it to be fixed ok.<BR><BR>Some of the letters seem to hang in there without breaking it, others definitely do break it. I don't know which is which. Since the game doesn't support Wii or other Font's well...yeah it's going to glitch.<BR><BR>For general chat: One or possibly 2 characters in a sentence or add is fine, but please do not use all Wii letters or other fonts as then it's very difficult to read and will be treated as we would treat texting. An occasional use is fine, don't overdo it.<BR><BR>If we have to translate the sentence it's out and violations might be assigned.<BR><BR>Again, a few letters here and there as long as the sentence is easily readable is ok. The entire sentence or most of the sentence isn't.<BR><BR>Hope this clears up a few things. :)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR></TABLE><HR><B>THIS THREAD IS CURRENTLY LOCKED, NO NEW POSTS AT THIS TIME.</B><HR>[ <A HREF='?FORUM=GAME'>GO BACK TO GAME FORUM</A> ]<BR><BR><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 WIDTH=100%>
