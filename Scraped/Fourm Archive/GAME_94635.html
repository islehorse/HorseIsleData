Things such as iPad, iPod, iTouch... do not support Adobe Flash which is what the game is programmed in.<BR><BR>So, Joe would have to 100% re-design the game and re-program it in probably HTML or something like that.  It would take a very long time to do that, and it would not be as much fun to play probably. <BR><BR> Also, as it would be a totally separate thing, you would have an account here, but you would not be able to access it from an App.  So for example you would not be able to log on and train unless you logged onto this game here.  This would be because the app would have to be in a totally different programing language.  And the game would out of necessity be somewhat different.<BR><BR>There is an app that you can use to access this game from iPad, iPod, iTouch, but it's not all that great, and you still need access to a keyboard of some kind.  You can sort of play from what I've heard, but it's a bit awkward and a bit limited.  (I don't have the app, so I'm going on hearsay.)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Rodeo)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 10 2013 12:06pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>The app is called Puffin Browser, and it works well enough to go on, say hi, check the bank, maybe train if you dont have a long list of horses. Pretty difficult on the iphone screen to use, but it's possible. I go on through my iphone occasionally when i'm away from home. The app works pretty well on tablets/ipads etc. but it's still kind of weird and limited.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by LokisSkitter)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 10 2013 4:11pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>@Rodeo, it PB an actual HI app?

Such as iPad, iPod and iTouch phones.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Rodeo)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 10 2013 9:08pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>^ what she said.  xD There is a free version of it that lasts like 2 weeks, and then after that it costs $2.99</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Faolan)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 11 2013 5:00am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I had it. If you refer people, you get more time. It's pretty cool, but it was laggy and crashed sometimes, and I used an iPhone 5 so I feel like it should have been faster.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Softly)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 13 2013 9:23am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I also tested out the app, Puffin Browser, and was pleasantly surprised. Although a little laggy, it alowed me to most anything I wanted to on HI. I reccomend it. On a sidenote, I was on my iPhone and the screen was small- Perhaps if someone tried it on an iPad things would work better?<BR>Thanks- Softly.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR></TABLE><HR><B>THIS THREAD IS CURRENTLY LOCKED, NO NEW POSTS AT THIS TIME.</B><HR>[ <A HREF='?FORUM=GAME'>GO BACK TO GAME FORUM</A> ]<BR><BR><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 WIDTH=100%>
