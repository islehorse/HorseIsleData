Not good. For this reason, “marriages” between players are not allowed.&quot;</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by ThisMagicMoment)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 25 2011 10:04am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Here's the whole shaboodle - Just sent the part about marrying. But here was everything, in case it answers any future questions :o)<BR><BR>&quot;Owning a player is considered slavery. Slavery is out totally in any and all forms. No buying, selling, owning others.
