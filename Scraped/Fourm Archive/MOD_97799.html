He'll ask if you'll his son Colbert and then mention that since they have few visitors, it's easy to get them mixed up with his son.<BR>That of course is understandable. Ask if you can do anything, after all you are looking to make some money.<BR>He asks you if you want to take an alpaca quiz. You pay him 1,000  and if you get all of the questions right you get   back 50 times that. If you get a question wrong, well, he keeps your money. <BR>Here's an easy one to start you off. Alpacas are native to which continent?<BR>South America<BR>They are native to the Andes Mountains in South America.  What are the Andes Mountains most famous for? <BR>They are the longest mountain range above water in the world.<BR>The Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the Atlantic Ocean is the longest mountain range in the world. Okay, shall we get back to alpacas?  Alpaca wool is known for what?<BR>Being more flame resistant than plant or synthetic fibers.<BR><BR>Its the perfect fiber to wear in case of fire as it does not melt onto the skin like synthetics do. How much lanolin does alpaca wool have?<BR><BR>It has no lanolin<BR><BR>It has no lanolin, making alpaca wool easier to process and less smelly than sheep's wool. Okay, next. What mammal is the alpaca related to?<BR><BR>They have a three chamber heart like camels, so I say they are related to camels!<BR><BR>They are members of the camelid family, which includes camels, llamas, guanacos and vicunas. A baby alpaca is called what? <BR><BR>A cria<BR><BR>A baby alpaca is called a cria. For the next question, Alpaca wool comes in how many natural colors? 22<BR><BR>There are 22 natural colors with many shades of those! The predominate color is white, which can be dyed any color of the rainbow.  Now for the next question. Alpacas give birth after how many months?<BR><BR>Like sea lions, they give birth after 11-12 months of gestation. <BR><BR>Horses also give birth after 11-12 months of gestation. Two more questions to go. The collective name for a group is called what?<BR><BR>A flock or herd.<BR><BR>Either flock or herd is acceptable. Now for your final challenge. Which of the following is FALSE? <BR>Alpacas are so fierce, mountain lions will not attack them.<BR><BR>Bonus Question<BR>Alpacas and llamas can successfully cross-breed. What is the resulting hybrid called?<BR><BR>Huarizo.<BR><BR>Reward $50,000 and 100 quest points, plus 1,000 for the bonus question (51k total)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jun 22 2016 12:29pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Thanks Piper!</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR></TABLE><HR><FORM METHOD=POST>Add a reply to this topic:<BR><TABLE><TR><TD><TEXTAREA NAME=TEXT ROWS=4 COLS=60></TEXTAREA></TD><TD><INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE='ADD REPLY'></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=SUBJECT VALUE='NOT NEEDED'><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=FORUM VALUE='GAME'><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=VIEWID VALUE='97799'></FORM>[ <A HREF='?FORUM=GAME'>GO BACK TO GAME FORUM</A> ]<BR><BR><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 WIDTH=100%>
