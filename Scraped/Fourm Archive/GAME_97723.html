This creates an unfair advantage thus is a form of cheating.<BR><BR>If you wish to whisper great!  However please do so fairly.  Warp to the Isle or town's warp point then go off in search of the horse.<BR><BR>I'm seeing what is starting to become &quot;warping wars&quot; and this is not tolerated.<BR><BR>No having buddies here and there all over the game so you can warp to them faster after whispering.  This is an unfair advantage to others who have buddies that are playing the game and don't wish to be a &quot;warp point&quot; or who don't have buddies on at that time.<BR><BR>Lets keep all playing fair and even for all players.  <BR><BR>If you wish to whisper when others are on and whispering at the same time that's fine, but don't expect to get the horse.  You may or may not.<BR><BR>Try working together, ask if others are whispering, split the whispers into groups.  Player 1 takes the first A-F, Player 2 Takes G-P, Player 3 takes Q-Z.  That type of thing.  Then switch around. <BR><BR>Or, choose isles you will cover, take turns whispering, if a breed is on one of your designated isles go for it.  If not, then the person whose designated are it is goes for it.  <BR><BR>Work together instead of trying to out do each other and beat each other to a horse.  This is beginning to get out of hand.<BR><BR>Thanks</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Molyneux)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Mar 31 2016 2:30pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>There are about 4 or 5 of us whispering on Pinto right now. We split it into groups as you mentioned above in attempt to find a clog, and after whispering the entire list, there were only 10 horses out. There's another thread about it but there MUST be a whispering glitch or something where horses aren't spawning.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Ghost)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Mar 31 2016 2:37pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I understand and appreciate the fact time has been taken out for a rule for whispering, but I don't like the fact we can't warp to buddies to get places faster? what if we are helping them find a wild?<BR> I worked hard for my 75% qp to be able to warp to places</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Vulpix)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Mar 31 2016 2:40pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Warping should be a channel that we can mute. People warp to me when I specifically ask them not to. I always report these things but it's really, really annoying.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Mar 31 2016 3:57pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>The idea for warping is to reach an isle faster, not specifically a particular spot on that isle.  So warping to a warp point is fine.  Warping to player after player after player to reach a wild before someone else who is whispering and has no buddies willing to be a warp point is not fair to others.  It gives one an unfair advantage.  <BR><BR>I don't think it would be possible to have it where players could turn off the ability of others to warp to them. I don't think that is possible.  Plus it still does not block the players willing to be warp points from creating an unfair advantage.  <BR><BR>Basically what is happening is an ability is being misused.  If it's used properly great.  If it's being misused to create an advantage for a player that others can't do, then it's not great.<BR><BR>I think about the only thing that could be done is to remove the ability to warp to players (if possible) and that is not something any of us want.  So, please do not misuse the ability to create an advantage to you personally.<BR><BR>Thanks</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Amber)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 1 2016 12:11pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I fully understand when warping to someone on top/after a wild horse, but I have not done that for either of the cases I have vios for.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Vulpix)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 1 2016 12:43pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Maybe the chat looks of the person warped to should be checked? For example. Say I warp to someone and get reported (by someone else for a separate incident) by a person I never warped to. Say Amber reports me because she sees me warp to Playername. Maybe check Playername's chats to see if they asked me for help? Or if they gave permission to me to warp to them.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Vulpix)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 1 2016 12:44pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Chat logs*</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Amber)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 1 2016 2:14pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Why not add !warp pegasus reuniter, !warp unicorn reuniter, !warp unipeg reuniter, !warp whisperer, !warp esj !warp wsj?</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Magi)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 2 2016 12:02am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>So is warping to players for any reason at all now against the rules?<BR>If so what is the point.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Goldfish)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 2 2016 12:23am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I understand that warping to a player to scoop their wild is against the rules - rightfully so - but I see more people lying &quot;they warped to me and took my wild!!&quot; than people actually doing it. The warping issue is a bit over-exaggerated, in my eyes?<BR><BR>But I don't understand why we're not allowed to use consenting players as warp points for a small 'advantage'. Unis and pegs are already HUGE advantages in most aspects of the game - they greatly trivialize questing and whispering. If I warp to a bud to go straight to the whisperer or to ESJ, I am not harming other players without buds with my &quot;huge advantage&quot;. I'm sparing myself a few seconds of time. Please don't penalize players having friends in a social game.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 2 2016 12:48pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>If you are chatting with another player, going to sell a horse, whatever...And that player is ok with it you may warp to them. <BR><BR>If you are whispering you may Not warp to specific players whether or not they are ok with it.  <BR><BR>Reasons:<BR>1) I have no idea if the person is or isn't ok with it. If they aren't ok with it then it's also harassment.<BR>2) It's a form of cheating and gives you an unfair advantage over those who don't have buddies willing to park somewhere for the sole purpose of being a warp point.<BR>3) We have all ages who play, we insist players be polite and nice and play fairly.  This includes with warping.<BR><BR>So if you are whispering, you may only warp to an isle location, which is a regular warp point, not to a specific player.<BR><BR>To add warp points goes into core programming.  I don't know if it's something that could be added in but I doubt it and I very much doubt Joe would wish to spend the hours necessary to do that just because some players are misusing an ability.<BR><BR>I can see in the logs whether someone is whispering or not, whether someone is using another as a warp point.<BR><BR>There are several players on more than 1 server who are misusing this ability (warping directly to others to gain an advantage over others who are whispering thus reaching the horse before the other player has a chance.)<BR><BR>I'm also seeing reports filed, and fights beginning to occur, anger among players is surfacing regarding this. So, lets stop it now.  I'm not going to let this escalate into warping/whispering wars. This is a peaceful game, not a place to come to and be harassed, upset or feel like you have to fight someone to be able to get a horse.<BR><BR>Even the playing field for all.  Whomever captures the horse gets the horse, all have an equal chance at that.<BR><BR>No warping directly to players if you are whispering.  Very simple.  <BR><BR>Thanks</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Centaur)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 2 2016 2:55pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Okay, so what if you have a bud on that is whispering and they ask you for help to look for the horse cause they have spent ages looking for it and you warp to them to do it? is that also against the rules?</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 2 2016 6:52pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>If you aren't whispering, and you warp to a friend who is doing the whispering that's fine.
