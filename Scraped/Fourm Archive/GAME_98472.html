I'm well into my adult years now but dang did the nostalgia hit hard when I loaded up HI1 for the first time in well over a year.<BR><BR>As someone familiar with how these games run, I'm not entirely sure how viable of an option this would be but I wasn't on when Joe and Miranda went over the closing details I figured I'd drop the suggestion/question.<BR>How possible would it be to release an offline version of the game? Tweak it a little to add more NPC presence in mini games, arenas, and auctions (as randomly generated horse sales) and I think it would be a fun game one could buy a copy of for their computer and play as a single player. I know I personally would purchase one if only for the nostalgia but I'm sure others would be interested in something like that? I never had the chance to complete all the NPC quests, or all the mini games, and the way HI1 formatted vs. HI2 and 3, it seems like a possibility? <BR>Again, I 100% understand this is probably not an option. Joe and Miranda have already put so much into a game that just doesn't have a lot of interaction anymore and they themselves had said they were losing money keeping it running. I understand they probably don't want to invest more into this game when their focus has (and should be) been on HI2 and 3. I just figured I'd mention that's something I thought of and would be interested in if the possibility ever arose.<BR><BR>Thank you for all the cherished memories, everyone. This game helped me through a very difficult childhood and I met some amazing people on here.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 8 2020 12:15pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Off line version is not something Joe wants to do.<BR><BR>There is a slight possibility that he will bring HI1 back IF we can still access Flash games (which we think we will be able to do.)  And if they are still popular.  <BR><BR>However it's a rather big &quot;IF&quot; so we will have to wait and see.  <BR><BR>HI1 is quite old, done in a very old version of Adobe Flash, and it would take a Lot of time to re-program the security for the game.  <BR><BR>It's something we will have to wait and see on.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by ChickenJoe)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 15 2020 10:45pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>dang, I kind of figured that would be the answer but it's still disappointing to hear. I understand though. <BR>I hope it's able to stick around for a while yet. I'd really like to see the lava isles again before the game goes, *laughing out loud!*!
