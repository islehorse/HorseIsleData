If they say they can do the profile without getting on the account, then it would be a total scam.  can't sell nor trade for the special font profiles</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by FrogLips)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jul 5 2011 12:51pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Ohh sorry I misread that Cont..

They had to be actually typed in.  If they can be copy/pasted, then that would work. However trading a horse is risky as they might not get it back.<BR><BR>I don't have anything that will do the special fonts so I can't test it.  When I tried to copy another players profile however the fonts didn't come though.  That could have just been my computer however. I was on the older one. *laughing out loud!*</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by FrogLips)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jul 5 2011 4:10pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I paid a couple of players to trade me over horses with the special fonts in their names and/or profiles.  If they trade a horse to have a special profile done it's the risk they take of not getting the horse back. The fonts can't be copied and pasted but you can trade a horse with the special fonts and they stay the same/fancy when traded back n forth</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jul 5 2011 6:02pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Ahh ok, Thank you Froggy! :)  I will pay you back when I get on next.

It was my choice, to experiment to find out if players did trade/train for a custom profile if the profile would stay the same.. Some players said yes some said no..

What they may not do at all is advertise for profiles containing the different fonts as they can't be copy/pasted, or do them for others either since the person doing the profile would Have to go onto the other persons account to do the special fonts. That is massively against the rules and could end up with both players banned, at least for a while.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Piper)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Aug 2 2011 7:23am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Dp, from what i'm understanding that you're saying is that the players, can't sell the special fonts, but if they havea horse with the spcial font, they can sell it with it. Correct? What about using the special font in global chat?  Pipsy</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Aug 2 2011 8:01am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>The font can be used in chats, that's fine.<BR><BR>What happens in the horse names and profiles is that some of those fonts, especially some of the wii characters break the save button.  The only way to fix it is for Miranda go go in and clean out the entire profile.  <BR><BR>If they were able to use the fonts and save them in the first place, then they are using characters that are ok, so they can sell that horse with the special name or profile.  But, since I'm not sure which characters break the save ability, they may not sell player profiles, or such.  If it's already there, fine.  If not, please don't put it there. *laughing out loud!*</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR></TABLE><HR><FORM METHOD=POST>Add a reply to this topic:<BR><TABLE><TR><TD><TEXTAREA NAME=TEXT ROWS=4 COLS=60></TEXTAREA></TD><TD><INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE='ADD REPLY'></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=SUBJECT VALUE='NOT NEEDED'><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=FORUM VALUE='GAME'><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=VIEWID VALUE='85843'></FORM>[ <A HREF='?FORUM=GAME'>GO BACK TO GAME FORUM</A> ]<BR><BR><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 WIDTH=100%>
