Ever had someone try to explain it to you and just haven't been able to get it? Read this!<BR><BR><BR>It hels if you are at least in 6th grade and/pr cn read bar graphs, but if you can't, I will explain that at the bottom of this page.<BR><BR>This is a mathematical statement for calculating UTs, I'll take you through it step by step.<BR>Divide the sum of the max personality and intelligence by the sum of the horses personality and intellegence. Move decimal. <BR>                          or...<BR>                  (MP+MI)/(P+I)= UTs<BR><BR>OK. Step 1. Open your computer calculator, or grab one in your house.<BR><BR>2. Find the breed max for personality and intellegence. (If you cannot figure out how to do this, skip to the last step). Our example numbers will be 800 for Intellegence and 900 for personality. This equals 1700. Remember/write down that number.<BR><BR>3. Add the horse's personality and intellegence. This would be the white number at the bottom. Our example numbers will be 700 for Intellegence and 800 for Personality. This equals 1500. <BR><BR>4. Divide the second number (1500). By the firt number (1700). Or just remember &quot;smaller by lager.&quot; <BR>This is 0.882352...<BR><BR>5. Move the decimal. 88.2352...<BR><BR>6. Cut it off. <BR>         88.2<BR>It may be tempting to round, but it's best to just cut it off. I personally like to include the second number after the decimal if it is 5 or above.<BR><BR><BR>Now! If you can't read bar graphs...<BR>There are 2 simple solutions. I teach you how to do it or give you a horse isle shortcut... kind of...<BR><BR>The shortcut would simply be to go to the library, look up the breed you are doing UTs on, and the white numbr is the max for that breed, and that horse.<BR><BR>It's actually faster to just look at the top of the red arrows to determine the max. If you look at the lines, they have a number to the right of them. The first line has 500 next to it, which means that line is 500. Every little line between the numbers respresents 100, so going up from 500, add 100 for every line. and if the top of the arrows is in between 2 lines, it will be the line below plus, or the line above minus 50. Say it was in between the<BR>700 and the 800, it would be 750. It may sound complicaed, but really, you can just look at it and see where it's at.<BR><BR><BR>Enjoy doing Uts!</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Aug 1 2011 7:02pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Here is my formula as well, hopefully this will also be of help to some. :)<BR><BR>Add what the horse could have = intel + pers.  Then add what the horse has = intel + pers.  Then divide what the horse has, by what it could have,  then multiply by 100 for the %.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR></TABLE><HR><B>THIS THREAD IS CURRENTLY LOCKED, NO NEW POSTS AT THIS TIME.</B><HR>[ <A HREF='?FORUM=GAME'>GO BACK TO GAME FORUM</A> ]<BR><BR><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 WIDTH=100%>
