I love the quests, searching for items, and the little rush I would get anytime I stumbled upon a wild horse (I have *never* been successful with the Whisperer, it's always been by happen chance I find any wild). When I learned Flash was no longer going to be supported, I restarted my game and came here so I could do as many quests as possible. It's been years since I've been on Lava, Pirate, or Cloud Isles. Sadly, I don't think I'll be able to reach them before the game's imminent demise. I have loved playing this game over the years, in been a place of solace when home life wasn't so great, when I dropped out of school, when friends passed away. I'll miss this game dearly, and I just want to thank Joe and Miranda for pouring their heart and soul into this game. I've never felt anything less from this game, and I appreciate all you have done to keep it running for years.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Pinestorm)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Oct 22 2020 8:55am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I've been playing since around 2008, and it feels weird to see the game come to an end.

I'm in tears saying goodbye to my pixel ponies and trotting around Earton one last time.  My best memory is playing on my aunt's desktop, showing my little sister the fun quests, enjoying a cream soda.  That was so many years ago, but I remember the exact same music that was playing.  I also remember nervously sweating, because I bid 70k (more than 90% of my savings) on a palomino Hanoverian in a bidding war and was determined to win it.  And I did win it, I was so proud!</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DiamondDiva)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Oct 24 2020 3:29am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I've been playing since late 07 and honestly I'm so sad but so grateful its stayed alive for this long. I started on palo and moved to pinto when it started to die down. I luckily managed to keep both accounts alive whilst at university and I've met some wonderful people over the years. I now signed up for HI3 (haven't played yet) but theres something so retro and nostalgic about the set up of HI1 that just kind of feels like home to me. I've seen my fair share of drama, exp races for top and catching epic horses which is just exhilarating. I was never one for questing really because of my patience *laughing out loud!* but my favourite memories will def include my buds. Im a very shy person in real life and overthink ALOT but the fun and jokes we have, questing together, catching wilds and just having a good ol' natter is what I love the most, I'll never forget my buds &lt;33</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Borealis)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Oct 25 2020 4:35pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I agree with you Diamond, the HI1 structure and graphics were so forgiving, and just simple, but wonderful.

I remember being a kid and wishing my real life was riding horses and doing quests for people. I still wish that, haha. I liked the second game too, but this one just felt so perfect to me.

My sister and I end up playing around the holidays almost every year when I can't be at home and it reminds me of when we were kids.

It meant a lot to have a place I could sort of 'come home to' as a kid when things were rough. And looking back now, it was especially important to have a space where it was safe to be a kid on the internet... where we could just have fun and nerd out on horse stuff. <BR><BR>So again, thank you so much to everyone who made HI1 an amazing place to be for so many years! &lt;3</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by AwayWeGo)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Oct 31 2020 5:53am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I've been playing since close to the very beginning and I am sad to see it go.

I made so many incredible friends and more importantly, this kept my heartwrenching love of horses alive. <BR><BR>I was never someone that could ride often or had their own horse. And this game has a beautiful community of people that have definitely got me through the worst times of my life.<BR><BR>I'm sitting here thinking of all the hours, days, late nights I spent playing this game. I'm thinking of all the friends I made from this game, the friends I got to go to coffee with as a result of this game. <BR>So HI - thank you. Thank you if you are reading and we never spoke, thanks if were friends, thank you if you ever saw my username pop up on your screen. Thank you for over 10 years of wholesomeness, love, and friendship. I have no doubt this game contributed to me still being here, and as dramatic as that sounds, I believe it with all of me.<BR><BR>Finally, thank you, Miranda, and Joe.

I honestly made some of the best friends, worked my way through my most cringe 'xD' phase, and somehow after 12 years and on my second account (unfortunately after my first one timed out) manage to make my way back on once and awhile even with a demanding schedule with school and work.<BR><BR>My most prominent memories probably include that one time I changed my username from Yahoo to Bing, and my buddies hated it SO much I changed it back probably within a week (hahah), taking turns with my sister, who played on Dun, on our desktop computer, and that one time I got in trouble with my mom because I wanted to play so bad I snuck out of bed and she caught me playing on the computer at like 12am.<BR><BR>Honestly it's weird to admit how a horse game was such a pivotal part of my childhood, and even adulthood, but it really, truly is so bittersweet to say goodbye. I'm not ready now, and probably won't be when the time comes. Unsure of how I will spend my free-time now when I don't have HorseIsle 1 to escape to (HI2 and HI3 just don't hit the same). <BR><BR>I can't even begin to say how incredibly grateful I am to Miranda and Joe, as well as the countless friends I have made over the years.<BR><BR>I certainly will miss this game dearly! :')</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by LeapofFaith)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Nov 3 2020 9:19pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I started on Palomino as HollyBerryGirl in '08 and have restarted a few times. I really got back into the game when I started college when I was feeling lonely and stuck in my dorm. I made lots of friends and lifelong memories on here. When I first started I would go through the auto list and go and hunt down any that were under 10k so I could sell them at the pawneer to make money. I remember the thrill of catching my first 99er, of finally walking on Lava and then Pirate and finally Cloud, the wall of blue chats filling my screen when trying to do the jungle caves, of throwing rotten tomatoes at buds, anticipating beauty competition results. This game and my buds got me through the hardest time in my life. Without it, I don't know if I could have gotten through it. It has made me laugh, it has made me cry, it gave me a break from the real world, and it has given me lifelong friends. <BR><BR>This game has nothing like it and it makes me tear up knowing its last day is near. It's simple yet beautiful. I actively play and love HI3 but its not the same as HI1. <BR><BR>Thank you to everyone who made the game what it is.

I've also always loved questing, so much so that I was one of those people who offered to do caves with people because I just enjoyed doing them so much. This game introduced me to MMOs and helped me come out of my shell. I remember laughing when I did a quest in Shellton and realized there were references to Firefly, and I've always wondered how many other references are hidden about in the world.

I'm having a hard time coming to with all of this, thinking that I won't be able to come back and talk to my oldest friends who still play around every now and then, or whisper to get my old glory-days horses back on my new account.<BR><BR>However, I knew once HI2 went live that it was only a matter of time. We lost people. So many. I'm surprised it stayed up this long, long enough for me to return to it and bid it a final farewell. I'm completely holding my breath on the off-chance that they will put in the time and bring HI1 back, throw some advertisements out and really let us bring back the original to it's full glory.<BR><BR><BR>If not, then I really do want to thank y'all for my childhood,for the memories made, and for the friendships I've made along the way. As cheesy as it sounds, this game helped me out a lot in terms of growing me as a person. Thank you. <BR><BR><BR>- Arbiter (Dasher &amp; Rio, Chestnut.)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by GimmieGum)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Dec 16 2020 7:55pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I've been here since 2007.

I'll be continuing to check in on the game. as long as it runs, i'll be playing. any players looking for me are welcome to mail me on pinto server. i'm so very greatful for all the friendships i have made and the memories we have had together. if i didnt get a chance to mail you guys im sorry! i didnt have access the couple months leading up to the start of the new year.

This game was a huge part of my childhood and in many ways, made my life wonderful.  It was a blessing when in 2020, I started working from home and needed a break from time to time.  The people I met on this game have been some of my best friends.  I have made amazing memories on this game and I will never forget that.  I wished that this game could continue on so younger generations could have a wonderful alternate world to escape into just like I did during hard times.  I sure hope this isn't the end.  But I want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart to Joe, Miranda and everyone else who kept this game going strong and fair.  I wish everyone the best in their lives!</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Nighted)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Feb 8 2021 8:54pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I've been playing this game since '07, and I originally started on Chestnut as KnightFallWolf. I've made countless friends who I still keep in contact with to this day. I literally grew up on this game like many of you did, and I remember some of my best memories were laughing with my buds about countless silly things. I remember catching my first brown TB and being so excited she was 86%, *laughing out loud!*. <BR>I restarted a new account last year due to quarantine and was able to reconnect with so many of my old friends - countless memories and people who have supported me through all of the big steps - graduating college, getting married...I've met some of my best friends through this game and that is something I won't ever forget.<BR>-Night/Knight</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Mar 22 2021 9:18am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>REPLY: (by RegisteredNurse) Mar 21 2021 12:00pm<BR>I have played this {for a long time.} I have gone through a few user names but in the last 5 years or so I really have grown my friends circle and have made some lifelong friends in this game.
