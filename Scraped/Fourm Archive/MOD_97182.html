They had that they were g ay (apologies for the filter avoiding here!) in their profile. After a *long* discussion prior explaining why preferences/orientation weren't allowed I asked them to remove it. She did, said she had a girlfriend and directed players to look at the gender listed and make the connection for themselves. I explained that she was more than welcome to just state she had a girlfriend - however pointing out the connection wouldn't be allowed as we don't need to know orientation. <BR><BR>She changed it to <BR>+so since i am not allowed to discuss a certain aspect of my life on this profile, i will simply let you know that i have a girlfriend<BR>+i am female<BR><BR>Is this okay?

If not then whoops that is my bad - I was referencing 'What is and isn't allowed in profiles' and told Butter that having a quick line saying you have a gf/bf/spouse is okay as long as it doesn't go into detail! *laughing out loud!*<BR>She was trying to worm her way around it.<BR>I believe Hal has posted something along the lines of 'supports anyone's love whether boy/girl/' in their profile where LGBTQ once was - I'll have to check next time I see it. Would that be ok to keep?<BR><BR>They're being stubborn it seems! *laughing out loud!*<BR><BR>Thanks for the help :)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>May 29 2015 1:01pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Basically yes but... We did allow that for a while, and though we are trying to be somewhat more lenient these days, doing so in this area isn't working very well.  It rather depends on how it's actually worded.  With the current state of competency by kids that wording is not so good. Nor do they understand the difference.  In this area it's up to the mod to determine if it's ok or not really.  <BR><BR>I'm seeing a ton of dating.  Players come on, state their preference in their profile and head off to pm players for dates.  Others state they have a girlfriend or boyfriend, which instead of it being understood that the person is not available due to... It's being taken as a date request.  So again, pretty much depends on how it's worded.<BR><BR>While we (game) seek tolerance, understanding and acceptance for all, we do have young children from all over the world.  Not all countries are tolerant.  Not all parents wish their young child exposed to all content.  <BR><BR>Since such topics have nothing to do with the game, I don't see a need to post them on the game.  We are a child's/family quest based horse game that doesn't allow breeding.  Thus no adult content.<BR><BR>Dating is adult content.  Gender preferences are adult content.  The pixel horses on this game don't care.  Nor do we, nor should others on this game.  So it's not something that needs to be discussed.<BR><BR>We do allow mods or players to state something like: PlayerX is my husband/wife.  That is to hopefully prevent being hit on so much by players.  However, even that these days will probably have the opposite effect.  Times have changed.<BR><BR>We are a bit more lenient on HI1 as basically that game is for ages 12 and up.  HI1 however is 8 and up and we do have some younger children who play, usually with their parents.<BR><BR>Hal's current content is adult and not appropriate.  We don't do player love.  Period.  We do not discuss gender preference or lack thereof on this game.<BR><BR>Zero content for such topics as gender preferences, LGBTQ or anything else adult.  Many parents are totally not happy about their young children asking what that is.  We are not a chat room, nor a public chat facility.  We are a kids game for all ages.  Content needs to remain child friendly/appropriate.  Adult content has no place on this game.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by OrbWeaver)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>May 30 2015 8:55am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I kind of thought HalcyonHeart might put that back in her profile once there was no mod on.  *sigh*<BR><BR>Does she realize that if we DID allow her to have that, we would also have to allow people to say if they DIDN'T support such topics?  And then we'd have fights CONSTANTLY because one profile says they support, and another doesn't...this is not the place for any of that.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Elanor)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>May 30 2015 11:45am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>So she (Halycon) currently has on:<BR><BR>* Supports any and everyone in their choices of who they love, boys, girls, it's all the same. <BR><BR>I noticed Apple asked you if it was ok, and you said basically yes, DP, but I'm confused as to what you were saying yes over. *laughing out loud!*! Is she ok to have that on her profile, or should we be asking her to remove it? Sorry! Thanks. :)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>May 30 2015 12:06pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>That too needs to go Elanor.  That entire topic is a no no regardless of how it's mentioned.<BR><BR>A player may state:<BR><BR>I have a girlfriend.<BR><BR>I have a boyfriend.<BR><BR>I am married.<BR><BR>That's it.  Nothing more.  It's preferred they leave that off as well since it has nothing to do with the game and isn't any other person's business.  But I believe a while back that Miranda said it was ok to have that.<BR><BR>However, when they deviate from that statement, then it heads into content that isn't allowed.<BR><BR>So, supporting others in something isn't appropriate for this game.  Saying:  I have a girlfriend and I'm a girl is out.  They are within that statement advertising a gender preference.  We have no need to know that.  <BR><BR>In Psychology I was taught that someone who felt the constant need to tell everyone about something personal or convert/convince others intensely was trying to actually convince themselves.<BR><BR>This is not a place to convince anyone regarding adult content or personal preferences.<BR><BR>If you like who you are regardless of what that is, fantastic!  Please do not cram whatever it is down my throat.<BR><BR>If you don't like who you are, work on it yourself or seek off game help.  Again, please do not cram it down my throat.<BR><BR>There are some games where it's fine.  This isn't one of those.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by OrbWeaver)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>May 30 2015 6:40pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Now it just says: &quot;A C C E P T A N C E Save Our Profiles&quot; with &quot;acceptance&quot; in rainbow colors.

I like rainbows!  But I'll check it out and see if any rule-breaking is going on.<BR>OrbWeaver&gt;Stray: as for the petitioning, that is unlikely to work.  This is a children's game and the rule about dating and gender preferences will stay.<BR>Stray: Oh it's not that but the writing is something like top oppressing profiles because of those rules. xD<BR>OrbWeaver&gt;Stray: I'll check it out and put the heads' up otu for the other mods.

These are topics best left to parents to teach their children.<BR>OrbWeaver&gt;Butterfinger: Or, as you so astutely noted in your profile, to learn in school.  This is not school.  This is not an individual's home.  This is a public game geared at children.<BR>OrbWeaver&gt;Butterfinger: So any rants about gender, equality, dating, etc...need to stay off of this game.<BR>Butterfinger: you do realize no one on here is a child right<BR>Butterfinger: also you are the one who just ranted at me<BR>BreezyBabeKay: butterfinger drew one in the bird one too cleared it<BR>OrbWeaver&gt;Butterfinger: That is not the point.

I realize that many work hard to make nice profiles.  I do not have the capablity of only deleting portions of profiles.<BR>OrbWeaver&gt;Butterfinger: so it is best if you do it yourself so you don't lose your entire profile.<BR>Butterfinger: can you outline those portions for me please?<BR>Butterfinger: you can just copy and paste :)<BR>OrbWeaver&gt;Butterfinger: no, I can only remove.  I cannot otherwise alter your profile.<BR>Butterfinger: can you click the question mark beside my username so that you can see my profile, and then copy and paste the &quot;offensive&quot; portions into this pm so i know what to remove? thanks!!!!<BR>OrbWeaver&gt;Butterfinger: you may not say &quot;I have a girlfriend and I am a girl.&quot;  You can say &quot;I have a gilfriend&quot; but that is it.

So yes, we do have young kids joining and playing.  Many are pulled off by irate parents due to the content on the servers, I receive mail from those irate parents from time to time.<BR><BR>If only US players were here, it won't be quite so bad as yes, such content is introduced into schools at second grade, around 8 yrs.  But other countries also play and for some of those countries this content at that young age is not allowed.  <BR><BR>So if we allow it, then basically we are limiting our player base to only US and basically 12 and over as many parents home school their kids in the US or send them to private school.<BR><BR>It's up to the parents to decide what their child is and is not introduced to and at what age.
