I found that out from the get go. <BR> <BR>First talk to Hedda again. She tells you that her husband George had an interesting person come by recently. He tells him tales if all sorts. From monkeys in a barrel to gnomes bones. Oh don't forget the Irish Elf or the giant  mushrooms or the flowers maze! No go figure! Monkeys that steal bananas&gt; Maybe he is a little bananas himself they're already thinking. I would too if I hadn't seen this stuff on here before,<BR>Hedda also tells you hepaidto stay the night  and was left before they had even gotten up. Strange thing is, he left this box behind thT can't be opened.<BR>Now any moves to where he went is unatainable...or is it?<BR><BR><BR>You  will do a lot of traveling so  I would rent a Peggy for it. I don't know about you, but I hate spending boat fare when you can warp there on a Peggy<BR><BR>And for those of you  looking for Josten, they are in Joylyn's cabin<BR><BR>*You will need 1 strawberry for this quest*<BR><BR>Fergus O'Toole  clue and 2 ferrets<BR><BR>Felton dino bones<BR><BR>Mona-- chickens<BR><BR>Wington Pet Shop<BR><BR>Cat Isle Dock Master<BR><BR>Hare Isle Dock Master<BR><BR>Jungle Dock Master<BR><BR>Vern<BR><BR>Jungle Food Store Owner<BR><BR>Hazel<BR><BR>Earton Dock Master<BR><BR>Griffin<BR><BR>Demetrius<BR><BR>Polar Isle Dock Master<BR><BR>Whorl Isle Dock Master<BR><BR>Cabin Isle Dock Master<BR><BR>Cabin Isle Store Keeper<BR><BR>Frannie Oakley<BR><BR>Go to palm tree cluster straight east of Frannie's house to get the monkey<BR>Go back to Frannie<BR><BR>Crazy Eddie - he asks for one strawberry  to tell you where to go next<BR><BR>Hudson<BR><BR>Josten<BR><BR>Return to Hedda and tell her that Josten will come by to get the box.<BR>Reward: You earned $110,000 and 300 quest points</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jan 21 2019 4:52pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Thanks :)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Desertmorn)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jan 27 2019 8:21am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Sorry you didn't like the quest, Piper.

Quests that you all think up for us are made to make us think and think hard. Even if it takes me a week to do it..I'll finish it.<BR> Yes, the rewards at the end are great and do make up for the time well spent on it too. Sorry if I worded it wrongly, but I do enjoy the quests, and couldn't think of anyone better than for ya'll to write them.  Kudos to ya! Keep up the great work! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Desertmorn)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Feb 16 2019 10:43pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>It's always a struggle to find a balance with writing the quests- so many of the long-time players want to be challenged, other players want the quests to be quick and easy. I'm always trying to find a way to bring something new to the table. I must admit, this one was a struggle for me to create, because I had to start at the end, knowing where it would begin, and work backwards. Several times I confused myself! It is always a pleasure to create a quest someone enjoys. I'm always hoping that I succeed in at least creating a smile.  :)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR></TABLE><HR><FORM METHOD=POST>Add a reply to this topic:<BR><TABLE><TR><TD><TEXTAREA NAME=TEXT ROWS=4 COLS=60></TEXTAREA></TD><TD><INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE='ADD REPLY'></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=SUBJECT VALUE='NOT NEEDED'><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=FORUM VALUE='GAME'><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=VIEWID VALUE='98349'></FORM>[ <A HREF='?FORUM=GAME'>GO BACK TO GAME FORUM</A> ]<BR><BR><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 WIDTH=100%>
