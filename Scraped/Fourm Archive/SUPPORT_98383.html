I've asked around and apparently this has been an issue for a lot of players. It's when I am talking to an NPC about a quest and their conversations just stop mid sentence. It's been really hard to do questing now because of this. Especially if it involves doing a quiz for an NPC. They will half start a question and you have to answer it. Some people suggested to zoom out, but I am unable to do that on my chromebook. Thanks!</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by OutFoxed)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jun 29 2019 3:36pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I have found that depending on the size of the window I have the game running on - the amount of NPC text changes. The best solution I've found is to use the (Enter the World) (Bigger Borders Version) (Same Window Version) buttons to enter the game instead of opening a new tab directly to the server. It's a pain and took me a couple of days to get used to it when I got a new laptop (as it was absolutely fine on my older one). But it seems to have worked just fine. Something about the dimensions and zoom.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertWind)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jul 1 2019 1:23pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>What OutFoxed said.  If that doesn't work, try highlighting the upper right box where the text should be and see if that brings it up.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by TheGuitarist)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jul 2 2019 12:07am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I'm still having trouble with it :/ But I appreciate the help!</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by TheGuitarist)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jul 2 2019 12:15am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I noticed that I can't finish quests because of this issue as well. Like, I'll have to look up how to finish a quest, but even with the help of the site, it won't allow me to find these quest items. I.e., Lucy, The Dancing Snake Quest, I should be able to search at the rocks to find her, however, she isn't there. All it says is that I cleared the rocks. I just want to get to 75% already!

Make sure you have talked to the people you need to talk to.  If one of them won't talk to you then there are other quests you need to do first.  :)<BR><BR>The text issue isn't something we can replicate, so it isn't really something with the game, it has to do with browser vs Adobe Flash.  <BR><BR>Try using Google Chrome as your browser if you aren't already.  If you are already using it try Mozilla Firefox.  See if that helps.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by TheGuitarist)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jul 2 2019 9:51pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I will try that, thank you!</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by TheGuitarist)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jul 3 2019 5:28pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I switched computers and it doesn't seem to be a problem on this one.
