Bay<BR><BR>It's small and sharp but a horse will wear it. Tack<BR><BR>This brush isn't made out of a tasty dish. Curry<BR><BR>In the desert sun I may look like gold and as a breed I'm very old. Akhal Teke<BR><BR>It's at the beginning of steeplechase, at the end of rodeos, and within horses? What is it? S<BR><BR>You may think it's a little corny, but I'm a pony and a horse! I can stand as low as 13.2 hands, but as high as 16, and that's a whale of a pony!  Welsh Cob<BR><BR>A Breed named after steep sided ocean inlets in Norway. Norwegian Fjord<BR><BR>I'm not the breed used by the RCMP, but you might yell, &quot;Oh, Canada!&quot; when you see me! What am I?  Canadian Horse<BR><BR>The question with this gait is, can you or can't you? Canter<BR><BR>&quot;Stubborn as a ?&quot; or &quot;Kicks like a ?&quot;  Mule<BR><BR>Buried Alive? I surely once was. Unburied I died. Should have been a 'Parrot', Then that horse wouldn't have done what it did to me. What was I?  Carrot<BR><BR>Because it's all ready.  An equine of this coloring rarely needs to do any work.  Dun<BR><BR>If my mother was my father and my father was my mother, my name would be Hinny. Instead I joined the army and I'm a plain old ____.  Mule<BR><BR>This horse breed may live in Germany, perhaps in Hanover? Hanoverian<BR><BR>You could paint this horse breed red, white and blue.  American Paint<BR><BR>A horse breed and a machine.  What am I?  Mustang<BR><BR>This animal spelled backwards is a very common destination for girls. Llama<BR><BR>Don't let my name scare you.  I'm not angry, although I might be a little hungry! I love a good steeplechase and I'm fast in the harness. Furioso<BR><BR>A type of shoe. Dogs like to chew some shoes, but not this.  In fact,  people like to play with this shoe when it's old more than dogs! Horseshoe<BR><BR>If a king sits on gold, who sits on Silver? Lone Ranger<BR><BR>This breed only throws half of what it's got. Haflinger<BR><BR>A confusing equine coloring.  Using either first or second alphabetical vowels.  Better use 'e' for me. Grey<BR><BR>It's monday.  You ride into town on Tuesday. One day passes.  What day is it? Tuesday<BR><BR>What word has these in common: tack, shower and to restrain. Bridle<BR><BR>I love oysters, saltines and the Sunshine State! What breed of horse am I? Florida Cracker<BR><BR>This footwear is very lucky. Horseshoe<BR><BR>My ears are my distinguishing mark. If they were charged up, you might see a spark! What breed am I? Kathiawari<BR><BR>My hooves are striped but my body is not. I can run a great distance without getting hot. What breed am I?  Appaloosa<BR><BR>Take a horse, divide it in two, repeat.  Resemble a breed? Quater Horse<BR> <BR>Justin's favorite horse is more than awesome, but what is its name?  Morgan<BR><BR>This equine coloring, mispronounced, suggests it is a friend<BR>of yours.  Palomino<BR><BR>This breed says this when left in very cold weather.  I'm ____!  Friesian<BR><BR>What equine color is also part of a horse? Chestnut<BR><BR>Name a breed that is from Kentucky, and is named after a piece of tack? Saddlebred<BR><BR>This breed is no hobbit, though you might have thought it at first, until you saw one. Shire<BR><BR>I may be stubborn but I'm always ready to listen. Mule<BR><BR>My bloodlines are ancient.  I was a warhorse for the Romans, a draft horse for medieval peasants, and a sure-footed, hard-wintering mountain horse for all of Austria. What am I?<BR>A: Noriker<BR><BR>What has 4 hooves, 2 ears, and blends with a crowd? Zebra<BR><BR>What has 1,000 eyes, 2,000 shoes and eats grass? 5oo Horses<BR><BR>Do you get hungry when you hear my name? Many people do! But I am not a breakfast pastry. What am I? Danish Warmblood<BR><BR>I was on my way to Treeton one day, when I met a girl with five horses. Each horse had five dogs, each dog had five cat friends, and each cat had five mice. All in all, how many were going to Treeton? 1<BR><BR>I'm a souped-up horse with plenty of spirit. I'm a star jumper who really knows how to leap up from down under, and I come in every color - even Botany Bay!  Australian Stock Horse<BR><BR>This horse breed and waffles go well together. Belgian<BR><BR>I don't think I'd like a nice Hawaiian one, but one from Suffolk might do. What breed am I? Suffolk Punch<BR><BR>I like to give MORE! They crossed two great breeds to make me, and now I'm my own breed.  What am I? Morab<BR><BR>This colored equine must really enjoy beans. Pinto<BR><BR>This sounds like the  most important thing, it sits between two corn and lies above a double 'i'. Mane<BR><BR>I don't pile up points, but I garner lots of praise! But please don't put wet dishes on me!  What breed am I? Racking Horse<BR><BR>Peanuts are named after the country this breed is from. Look hard.  I'm no illusion. Andalusian<BR><BR>You may receive this equine breed for valentines day, but smaller and it  tastes like chocolate! Belgian<BR><BR>Your friend always keeps water bottles in her backpack. What animal does this remind you of? Camel<BR><BR>A meticulous loaf of wheat that is also an equine breed. Thoroughbred<BR><BR>Name a breed that is from Kentucky, and is named after a piece of tack? Saddlebred<BR><BR>I'm a breed from Central America...don't pass me by, and with an Italian accent I'm so fine! Paso Fino<BR><BR>This tack isn't very happy. Saddle<BR><BR>When mature this horse breed is white and don't give it any lip about it!  Lipizzan<BR><BR>Your horse is in a race. You are picking up speed and pass the horse that is in 2nd place. What place are you in now? 2nd<BR><BR>I must be done by now.  I've been domesticated for 4,000 years! I have a thick shaggy coat and love the snow, but I can jump and even do dressage. There's no way you won't love me. Norwegian Fjord<BR><BR>This breed has a big heart but comes in a small package and is from the island it is named after. Shetland<BR><BR>I'm ardent about drafting, and so I should be! I'm the oldest known draft breed and I fought with Napoleon. What breed am I?  Ardennais<BR><BR>Your horse might be fast but still, it cannot beat this in a race.  While it might be smaller than your horse at noon,  it can be quite larger at other times of the day.  At night,  you will have trouble finding it.  Shadow<BR><BR>What is an Equus Caballus? Horse<BR><BR>An equine coloring and yet not a color.  Without light, likely visible at night. White<BR><BR>An equine coloring; high in the forest; an open fire. Chestnut<BR><BR>Your horse might shout this, or shout for this. Hay<BR><BR>What word has these in common: tack, shower and to restrain. Bridle<BR><BR>Not only is this a salad dressing, you might find a horse here too! Ranch<BR><BR>You are in a field with 3 horses, Babe, Bob, and Ben.  Ben is standing on his back legs,  Bob is standing on one more leg than Ben. Babe is standing normally.

Appaloosa<BR><BR>I'm the &quot;horse of the sea.&quot; My coat is white or grey like the sea foam, so bring your camera for a picture! Camargue<BR><BR>No, I'm not made of French maize! I'm an old, proud breed. Norman Cob<BR><BR>I'm a big, milky-white horse who's risen to the top in America. I can truly say I'm the top of the crop! <BR>What breed am I?
