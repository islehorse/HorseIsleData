Eventually Flash will stop, the game is programmed in Flash so obviously there will be a problem.<BR><BR>The owners are aware of this, they have several options.  <BR><BR>Some of those are:<BR>~ Trying to find a work around for Flash and keep the game as is.  <BR>~ Possibly re-doing Horse Isle in a different format.<BR>~ Having another game all together.<BR><BR>Now, there are several other options, those are what I thought of off the top of my head.  We have 2 years.  Plenty of time for the owners to decide and implement whatever they choose to do.<BR><BR>In the mean time Horse Isle is and will be here for as long as players can access the game at all.<BR><BR>At this time it's really premature to get all upset about this.  I know the owners are looking into this, again they have several options.  So lets sit back, enjoy the game and let the owners worry about it. :)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Nebulous)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jan 1 2018 10:04pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>How would re-doing Horse Isle work?

I think this would cut down your running costs quite a bit (you have so many functionally empty servers), and allow all players to interact.<BR>Two problems I can think of,<BR>1. Ranches: Everyone's ranch is sold and refunded, and everyone will have to purchase a new ranch (basically reset ranches to avoid overlaps). This might be hectic for the first week or so but I think manageable.<BR>2. Players on multiple servers. I know some longtime players keep their old accounts alive while playing on pinto since it's most active. Not sure about this one. Give us some time to sort stuff and choose which account migrates. Probably will be a few issues with players stockpiling horses and money onto each other, but maybe you could work something out.<BR><BR>I think many of us would be receptive to some losses in terms of money/time it takes to transfer our data, if it meant more longevity for the game and probably a few more active players on one server.<BR><BR>It's just my 2cents. :)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Savy)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Feb 21 2020 11:21am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I really like this idea, the only problem I really see is quests and all.

So a different game.  And HTML doesn't work for this type of game, it would need to be C something anyway.<BR><BR>Thus a download game.  <BR><BR>We are still hoping that someone somewhere will come up with a way to keep Flash going.  <BR><BR>There is HI3 if you can do downloads.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by MellyMonster)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Feb 22 2020 4:27am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I agree with MadHare about the ranch idea.

Surely someone will come up with a way to continue Flash games.  <BR><BR>Putting a lot of energy and effort into the games though as much as we want them to continue and hope they will indeed continue is not practical.  <BR><BR>So for now, Joe is working on HI3 as it's going to stay around.  It's a very flexible game and programmed in C#.  <BR><BR>There are absolutely NO plans to close HI1 or HI2 down.

It's wait and see. I'll keep checking, but for now it's really up in the air. There are hundreds of Flash games out there so totally dumping Flash is not really a good thing.<BR><BR>It's also possible as Jor mentioned in his part that we could use an old version of a browser that will still allow Flash.<BR><BR>So be sure you have the Flash .swf file saved on your computer or on a Flash Drive so you can switch it to a new computer if needed.

He has something in mind he is hoping will work, we will have to see however it if will work with the browser block.
