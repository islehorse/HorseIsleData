If a player reports something to you, that player must remain anonymous.  Please do not ever share that identity except with another moderator or admin.<BR><BR>Also watch for the player &quot;gossip&quot;  just because Player 1 says that Player 2 said something, doesn't mean Player 2 did.  Many players &quot;report&quot; others to become a moderators &quot;pet&quot;  or to feel important.  If you didn't see something, then it didn't happen, please do not &quot;act&quot; upon something you did not see in chat.<BR><BR>If it bothered a player then that player can file an abuse report.  If you feel it's important that the chat be saved you may file an abuse report on the player and ask us to review chat for ___ .   Otherwise, please do not get involved as you didn't see the chat so it's hearsay or gossip.<BR><BR>When a player tells me that RuleBreaker broke a rule and said 'such and such,' I tell the player to please file an abuse report.  Since I didn't see it I can't do anything about it.<BR><BR>If someone tells me that RuleBreaker has a bad profile I thank the player:  &quot;Thanks, I'll check it out.&quot;  Or something like that.  If it's correct, then I ask RuleBreaker to please remove that bad part, but I Do Not tell them the name of the player who &quot;reported&quot; them as that is confidential.  I might say someone brought it to my attention, but that is absolutely all.  Usually I don't even say that, I just say I was looking at profiles, or I was looking at your horses... <BR><BR>We must Not have favorites or at least show favoritism to players, nor can we encourage or contribute to player rivalry or gossip. <BR><BR>And please also remember that whatever happens in this moderator forum, stays here.  We don't discuss these topics or issues with others. :)<BR><BR>Ok, gets off soap box now and goes back to workie. :)<BR>DP</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by LorienSunStar)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jun 30 2010 1:32pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Ok DP :) I also think its really important not to copy and paste things from mod chat into buddy chat plus conversations you have with players because if the muted player or the offending player hears of it it doesnt look good.
