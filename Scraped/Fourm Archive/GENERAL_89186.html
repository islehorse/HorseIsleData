You can't trade a horse with the foal attached to the horse.  It must be entered as two entries.  One overall trade, but Player1 has the money, Player2 is selling 1. a horse and 2. a foal.  :)  Foal must be included at the time of the trade.  Foals can't be wrapped as presents. They no likey enclosed boxes... :D</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Secret)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Dec 3 2011 6:26am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I had this happen to me once when I first started!

If there is a moderator on you can bring this to the moderators attention, sometimes they are actually trying to play and miss things occasionally.  Otherwise just file the report.  You could also pm the new player and tell them to be sure and do a fair trade, that expensive items or foals can't be wrapped.  Don't put the other player down, just inform them of how the game works. :)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR></TABLE><HR><B>THIS THREAD IS CURRENTLY LOCKED, NO NEW POSTS AT THIS TIME.</B><HR>[ <A HREF='?FORUM=GAME'>GO BACK TO GAME FORUM</A> ]<BR><BR><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 WIDTH=100%>
