Although some people were going overboard and causing trouble, I feel that the admins are not taking our views into consideration. A lot of oldies like myself have moved over to Pinto from other servers and are restarting. The new interest amount actually makes the problem worse, as now people still are rich and it is impossible for everyone else to catch up. And the auctions buttons make it so that the rich people are now auctioning good horses for high, that used to be the only cheap way to get a good horse. Please consider our opinions.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Mar 3 2016 12:02pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>As far as I know Joe is not planning to change the interest again. So what we have is what we have.<BR><BR>We need to learn to work with the current system.<BR><BR>It's more difficult to maintain billions now, it's easier to earn money for new players, so what the &quot;established&quot; players will need to take into account is the economy is now lower. No more selling things in the billions, it's now millions.<BR><BR>Once this happens, and once new players have earned money, then the economy will balance out in the millions instead of billions.<BR><BR>It's a different way of doing things, it will work. It is going to take a little time for the leveling out to happen.<BR><BR>You make more money from new quests, it's much easier to gain money as a new player. Interest rates are doubled on all money up to and including 500 mil. So work hard, do quests and you will get up there rather quickly. It does however required some hard work if one wishes to gain quickly.<BR><BR>The high auction button will in time become unused as players won't be spending billions on very many things. It takes quite a while to get that amount back up once spent.<BR><BR>Locking this thread as it's not something that will change, so it will end up with players arguing back and forth.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR></TABLE><HR><B>THIS THREAD IS CURRENTLY LOCKED, NO NEW POSTS AT THIS TIME.</B><HR>[ <A HREF='?FORUM=GAME'>GO BACK TO GAME FORUM</A> ]<BR><BR><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 WIDTH=100%>
