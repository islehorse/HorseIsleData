They very much know that is against the rules. I was more afraid of other people seeing it since several had reported it to me.<BR><BR>If it's that bad, is it okay to do what I did?

When a profile is extremely inappropriate, or if pretty much the entire profile is nasty, go ahead and remove.  If it's easy to discuss it with the player, then great, otherwise get it off. *laughing out loud!*<BR><BR>When there is only 1 sentence, or a small part that is not appropriate, but not totally bad it's nice to give the player a chance to remove it.  Especially if they have lots on their profile that is ok.<BR><BR>Just remember, this is a family game and young children and their parents do play.  We are a bit more lenient with profiles than global, since players actually have to go look at it.  However if it's severely breaking the rules, such as racism, adult explicit content or totally bad language then it needs to go immediately.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Continuum)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Dec 11 2010 8:48pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Yeah, that's what I figured, I just didn't want to overreact.

She isn't graphic or explicit with the violence angle.  And it's a book and book characters she is discussing. Saying Date of death isn't great but she does make it clear it's a books character, and she doesn't state how the death occurred.  :)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by BoneGirl)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Dec 12 2010 8:07pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Ok thanks.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR></TABLE><HR><FORM METHOD=POST>Add a reply to this topic:<BR><TABLE><TR><TD><TEXTAREA NAME=TEXT ROWS=4 COLS=60></TEXTAREA></TD><TD><INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT VALUE='ADD REPLY'></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=SUBJECT VALUE='NOT NEEDED'><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=FORUM VALUE='GAME'><INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=VIEWID VALUE='79984'></FORM>[ <A HREF='?FORUM=GAME'>GO BACK TO GAME FORUM</A> ]<BR><BR><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 WIDTH=100%>
