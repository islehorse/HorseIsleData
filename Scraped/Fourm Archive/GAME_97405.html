This is different for each browser.<BR><BR>Firefox:<BR>Tools -&gt; Clear Recent History -&gt; make sure Cache is selected, then<BR>click Clear Now.<BR><BR>Internet Explorer:<BR>Safety -&gt; Delete Browsing History -&gt; make sure History and Temporary<BR>Internet Files are checked, then click Delete.<BR><BR>Google Chrome:<BR>Three bars icon-&gt; Tools-&gt;  Clear browsing data.  Or do Ctrl+Shift+Del.<BR><BR>Safari for Mac:<BR>Safari -&gt; Empty Cache -&gt; Click Empty.<BR><BR>Safari for Windows:<BR>Edit -&gt; Empty Cache -&gt; Click Empty.<BR><BR>Opera:<BR>Click on the Opera icon (upper left) -&gt; Settings -&gt; Delete Private Data.<BR><BR>If this does not solve your problem, do it again, then shut down your<BR>computer completely, wait for at least 30 seconds, then start it back<BR>up again.<BR><BR>If you are still having  a problem try using a different browser such<BR>as Mozilla Firefox,  Google Chrome,  Opera or Safari.<BR><BR>Do try Opera if you are still having a problem as it uses less memory to run.<BR><BR>Be sure you don't have any other application running on your computer<BR>at the same time such as music, chat messaging, or any other app.<BR><BR>In Settings (click on wrench/spanner in lower right corner) go to &quot;Low Detail.&quot;<BR><BR>  If you are on WiFi, and if it's possible, try connecting directly to<BR>the modem via an ethernet cable and see if that helps.<BR><BR>  Also, if you are going to be competing, try logging off then back on<BR>just before entering the competition.  That will clear out the buffer<BR>and help speed it up a bit possibly.<BR><BR>  And, if you do experience lag, log off then back on.  If that helps,<BR>then it's a buffer issue which really can only be cleared out by the<BR>log off/on.<BR><BR>  If you still are having lag, check and see if you need to update any<BR>drivers on your computer, especially video drivers.  An out-dated<BR>driver can cause a lot of lag and they frequently need to be udpated.<BR><BR>Do check those drivers. :)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by FlashOfHope)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Oct 19 2015 3:54pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Was kinda hoping someone else would post this...but since they haven't...<BR><BR>Trying not to sound too rude here...but the math doesn't add up.<BR><BR>I highly doubt that every single player doesn't clear cache or uses the same browser even. I know in my home RIGHT NOW....I have 3 completely different computers. I have my old dino, my 7 month old laptop, and my roommate's custom built gaming pc. All 3 computers play this game the same. If I'm jumping, I have 30 minutes before lag becomes unbearable. If I am whispering, maybe 45 minutes. Questing, I have about an hour. On all 3 computers. My internet provider has been changed 3 times since June(Roommate got a &quot;good deal&quot; with a company known for breaking contracts, fixed the problem by going with a company that doesn't work if there is a tiny cloud in the sky, and I fixed his problems by going back with the original company). <BR><BR>I keep all the computers here bug free and fully updated.<BR><BR>So...when my 10 year old desk top is running a game the same as the super gaming computer...it is NOT a computer issue. All 3 Internet providers ran the same. Outside of the cloudy day idiots, I could only use that one when it was sunny. But still ran the same on those nice days.<BR><BR>I know the lag is not caused by &quot;too many players&quot; as I have seen mentioned. I first joined a few days after the game began. I remember stuff that very few even recall. I remember FULL servers with no lag. <BR><BR>These solutions that are given here...are what I was told to do back when I couldn't get my game to load a few years ago. I'd get that stupid purple screen. It wouldn't do anymore than that. <BR><BR>I lost my account because I was told that the issue was on my side. I had a collection of 99% horses and a 100%. Because THIS was the fix. I tried logging in on my computer, library computers, friend's computers, and my cousin's(Who was a player as well). I could sign into my cousin's account on MY computer, but my own wouldn't load. 7 years worth of work on that account. Gone. <BR><BR>Maybe its time to realize not all problems are on the players. <BR><BR>EVERYONE I have talked to has the SAME issue going on right now. The odds of them ALL using the SAME browser, not updating, not clearing cache, being wired/wireless, AND playing on the same age/model of computers...odds of being hit by lightning are higher.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Oct 19 2015 10:32pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Some players experience lag, some don't.  I do not have lag when on HI.<BR><BR>Many players don't have lag.  Some players do.<BR><BR>The above is about all we can do since the game is the game, there isn't anything Joe can do about lag that only some players experience.  Since not all players have lag, it isn't the game.<BR><BR>It has to do with players internet or computer or area/location.  Each internet company is different.  It might be lost packets at the intermediary server.  Signals go from your home to the internet provider then to a server that then directs the signal to the game server.  That directing server is independent, and might or might not be working well.  We have nothing to do with that server, it's under contract with your internet company, however the internet company does not own it or control it. (USA)<BR><BR>There are many other issues that can also arise.  It might have to do with where you are in the world verses the location of the servers.  The further from the server the more lag.  At this time...I think...The servers are in Minnesota USA.  If not, then California USA probably.  I'm not totally sure.<BR><BR>Since this doesn't happen to all players, there really isn't much we can do other than the above recommendations.  I am not at your home to run diagnostics on your computer and internet company nor run a path ping (for dropped packets,) as well as other things.  <BR><BR>Different browsers run differently on different computers.  Even of the same brand, each computer is slightly unique.  What works on one may or may not work well on another.  Opera browser uses less memory to run so we recommend that if you have lag.  It may or may not help...It's just something that might help.<BR><BR>The game servers are old.  Some computers may have problems with that possibly.  I really don't know.  These things (computers) can be very finicky and picky sometimes.  One computer will like something, another won't.  <BR><BR>The above are suggestions that may help with the most common problems.  If they don't solve your problem I'm sorry.  I'm not in a position to recommend any other options.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Starbuck)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Oct 21 2015 3:26pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I play a lot. Sometimes I have lag, as follows:<BR><BR>I play on Firefox. I usually have multiple browser windows open in the back and then the game open in a smaller window of its own. Some background sites seem to add to the lag ie. having certain social media sites open will slow my game play down so if I am whispering I leave those sites. The difference between having them open and not, to me, is approx. 10 FPS (horrible lag) vs. 21 FPS (a very acceptable speed for whispering etc.) so a notable difference.<BR><BR>At some other times the lag 'builds up' after I have played a while and I sort it by logging out and back in which gets me back to my top speed which seems to be around 21 FPS.<BR><BR>So on my end the lag issues are manageable and seem to be tied to my own actions and Internet use. I play/browse accordingly.<BR><BR>Maybe not helpful but I just wanted to add a positive perspective.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR></TABLE><HR><B>THIS THREAD IS CURRENTLY LOCKED, NO NEW POSTS AT THIS TIME.</B><HR>[ <A HREF='?FORUM=GAME'>GO BACK TO GAME FORUM</A> ]<BR><BR><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 WIDTH=100%>
