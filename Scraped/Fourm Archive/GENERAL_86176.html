This game is not a religious game, there is no reason to discuss religion here.  This is a family, quest/horse based game.  Many parents allow their children to play because we do Not allow religion on this game.  There are other places you may go to discuss this topic but not here please.  My religion might upset you, yours might upset me... who knows, and it's not important for this game. So please keep of. :)<BR><BR>No Violence, no threats, no graphic content.  Remember young children do also play this game.<BR><BR>No death, no jumping off places, hurting, being hurt.<BR><BR>No dating, date speak.  No adult content in any form.  Again young children play here.<BR><BR>No defaming/slandering another person. No hate lists.<BR><BR>No words that normally would be caught by the filter.  Just because the filter doesn't work for profiles, doesn't mean it's ok to use that word there. :)  You may use the filtered word, but not the &quot;original&quot; word.<BR><BR>Watch Lyrics... most are not appropriate for this game.  If they are not ok, you may change the words or content but you may not just post inappropriate content whether it be lyrics, poems, or whatever the content is still inappropriate. :)<BR><BR>No real names.  If you usename is Connie you may say, Hi I'm Connie.  Well yeah pretty obvious there so great!  You may not say Hi, my real name is Connie.  This is for your protection.  You may say My nickname is Connie.<BR><BR>No registered horse names, these can be traced directly to you.<BR><BR>No locations such as town, city... school attended, age, grade in school.  No Ages or age ranges are allowed this is for the safety of our players.  This includes Adult, Teen, Pre-Teen, Tween...<BR><BR>Allowed:<BR>RIP: Pet/horse name. (Non Registered)  Dad, Mom, relative or friend.  May have birth date and final date.  No other content.  If someone wishes to know more they may pm you.<BR><BR>May have many many things as long as they are ok for ages 6, 7, 8.  While we do not allow players to share their ages we do have some very young players on this game.<BR><BR>You may say Goth or Emo or whatever just watch the rest of the content. ;)<BR><BR>Horse Names:<BR>Not Allowed:<BR><BR>Violent names, threatening names, defaming/slanderous names.  No blood, gore, death, adult content - including implied adult content. No words that would normally be caught by the filter.  You may use the filtered word, but not the unfiltered version.  No avoiding the filter.<BR><BR>Allowed:<BR><BR>Sniper is ok, but not Sniper Attack  as that becomes threatening.  Gun is ok, but not Guns You Down.  That is not ok as it's a threat.<BR><BR>Blood Red is fine it's a color,  but if used in the non color or non breed area it's not ok.<BR><BR>--<BR><BR>Remember this is a family game. ALL content must be child friendly.  This still leaves you lots of  available content.  You don't have to post adult content just because you are above the child age.  This game will Not have &quot;adult&quot; servers.  It was designed as a game for the entire family as that is what the owners want it to be, that is what we insist it be.  So please keep all content family friendly.  :)<BR><BR>There are other sites you can go to if you can't follow the above rules for a family game. <BR><BR>Thanks for taking the time to read this.  If you have further questions please ask, I will try to check on this post periodically.  Do Not fight or argue.  <BR><BR>Note: We do not arbitrate or debate the rules.  Freedom of speech does not apply to privately owned games.  Especially if we wish to keep this family rated.  Players clicked on Accept when they signed up to the game.  That was a legally binding agreement that stated you had read and agreed to follow the rules of the game.  We do hold players to that agreement.  Those are the &quot;laws&quot; of this game.  :)</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR></TABLE><HR><B>THIS THREAD IS CURRENTLY LOCKED, NO NEW POSTS AT THIS TIME.</B><HR>[ <A HREF='?FORUM=GAME'>GO BACK TO GAME FORUM</A> ]<BR><BR><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0 WIDTH=100%>
