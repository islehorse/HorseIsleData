Even when flash is retired in 2020, we are assuming there will be ways to continue to run the flash player. It is our intention to continue supporting HI1/HI2 for as long as players are enjoying themselves and their horses.<BR><BR><LI>HI3 will be 3D. That said, it will have a very similar feel and look to HI2. It should run better, and allow us to pursue some new and interesting game mechanics.<BR><BR><LI>HI3 will not be as complex as HI2, at least to start. :) But it will have some completely new aspects and gameplay. We need to keep the features limited for initial release. It will be a completely different game.<BR><BR>Now, we are excited about this, but not going to start talking about what we are doing, or any hints at this point, because we are still in heavy alpha and huge changes can take place, so no point in talking about it. Other than it is our goal to create a solid, fun, playable game that will continue to support this great community of horse lovers. There is SOOO much work to do that any time spent in communication takes away from building the game, so I will need to focus if there is any chance of completing.<BR><BR>When it's bolted down more (in a few months,) we'll release more information.<BR><BR>I do however, <b>need some help from you</b> all. Answers to a few questions would be great:<BR><BR>1) Is the fact that there is no breeding and that horses do not die important to you? Eternal Horses vs Breeding is a big decision to be made. Please give a short answer of your preference.<BR><BR>2) Please order in your preference of gameplay mechanic, favorite first:<BR>Chat, Crafting, RanchBuilding, HorseImprovement, AdventureGathering, WildHorseHunting, Puzzles, NPC/Quests, Competition<BR><BR>3) Briefly, what is your favorite part of HI1/2?<BR><BR>4) Briefly, what is your least favorite part of HI1/2?<BR><BR>5) If you only play HI1, what was the reason you stayed here instead of playing HI2?<BR><BR><BR>Thanks much everyone!!!

Thank you for taking the time to keep us informed and to continue making the games that we've loved and enjoyed for over a decade.<BR><BR>1. I'd prefer that horses are eternal. I think that breeding is an amazing addition with so many cool possibilities, but the downside is that horses will die. I don't really see the point in pouring hour after hour of effort into training when they eventually pass away, although I'm sure the game would still be very enjoyable with that in place.<BR><BR>2. That's a tough one. If I'm understanding this question correctly, I'd say chat is first because the game is so much more fun with other people. Wild hunting second, then horse improvement, competition, ranch building, puzzles, quests, adventure gathering, and crafting.<BR><BR>3. Favorite of HI 1 - aside from the nostalgia, I love the whisperer and how competitions work, as well as horses' stats. It's straightforward, clean, and a good way to look at their value. Favorite of HI 2 - the art is stunning. And, even though I'd prefer no breeding if it means death, it's really cool to see the offspring of two of your favorite horses. The color and stat possibilities are incredibly cool.<BR><BR>3. Least - Pellets in HI 1. I don't mind height/color, but UTs was what made 99s/100s so valuable. When we got the option to change that, the rarity of them went down and messed with the economy. Least of HI 2 - the chat, and the fact that everything is subscription required. I get that funding and support is needed, and I'm personally more than happy to do it! But I like HI 1's approach to this much better. The competitions in HI 2 were also a bit confusing and I didn't like them as much as HI 1's (although I'm sure there's many people that disagree — it's just not my thing).<BR><BR>5. Again, there's a good nostalgia factor, but I also think it's a more approachable game. I like how whispering, competition, and stats (with the exception of UT pellets) all work. The chat is also a massive reason I quit HI 2 and stayed here.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by SkyRunner)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 26 2018 3:32pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>1. I like the idea of breeding, but for collections and gameplay, eternal might make more sense. Perhaps 2 servers, one with and one without? Although I understand the coding would be very different. Overall, I'd prefer eternal.<BR><BR>2. Wild Horse Hunting, NPC/Quest, Horse improvement, chat, crafting, competition, adventure gathering, puzzles, and ranch building. <BR><BR>3. My favorite part would definitely be whispering on HI1, and on HI2, I really loved all the different color combinations. There are so many variations of the same color unique to horses that would be great to see in the next game. <BR><BR>4. The res counter on HI1 introduced a really frustrating variable. I'd prefer no pellets at all to pellets if they must be counted. In HI2, I wish there was a whisperer, and I agree with Tesla that I'd prefer the subscription system to be like HI1. <BR><BR>5. The lack of a whisperer and the difficulty of starting/figuring out HI2 were the major things that kept me on HI1.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by PjGirl)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 26 2018 3:57pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>1) Is the fact that there is no breeding and that horses do not die important to you?

I get somewhat attached and I don't like the idea of investing time into training and such only to have them die.<BR><BR>2) Chat, Questing, Horse Hunting and Ranches are all the same tier for me, and the rest I don't have any particularly strong feelings towards.<BR><BR>3) Everything might be a cop out. The isles, the uni and peg, and the simplicity of it. But 100% Simple Jump and the whisperer are what keeps many players active on HI1, aside from the chat.<BR><BR>4) I agree the restricted chat is my least favourite part of HI1 - people are vio'd and banned for the simplest of things and it just does not match the player base. We are, in majority, adult players who grew up with the game, so that might be worth considering when deciding the target audience of HI3. I know for many, the strict rules and easy vios/bans are why players have quit. Aside from that, I dislike the idea of residue and the lack of admin interaction with the economy. The game economy has its ups and downs just like real life, and where the banks intervene here, it would be great if a new game could reflect these things. (It would prevent the insane evonomy changes HI1 has experienced).<BR><BR>5) I honestly prefer the graphics and simplicity of the game. It is easy and enjoyable for everyone of all ages. HI2 was just... too much of everything. It was too intricate and not as relaxing/fun to play. Plus, you can't do much on HI2 without a subscription.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Lacuna)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 26 2018 4:37pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Thank you so much for finally bringing HI3 up for discussion, I'm excited to have something to hope for. <BR><BR>1) Eternal horses. Most of the HI1 fanbase enjoy the aspect of competition and 'top' horses, so funneling hours of exp into a horse seems null and void if the horse will die. Maybe give a possibility of combining a player's two favorite horses or something but make it a one time only thing? Like each horse can only be 'bred' one time and the 'offspring' be immortal as well, to get a horse with combined characteristics to make a better horse?<BR><BR>2) Competitions, wild horse hunting, and quests are really the only things I do in game, with a heavy EMPHASIS on competitions.<BR><BR>3) My favorite part of HI1 are the jumping arenas and the whisperer. Questing is tolerable to make the Uni/Pegs available but I'm willing to do those. I don't have a favorite thing about HI2 because I played briefly and hated it. The only positive thing I saw with HI2 were the breeds and their art with the different colorings available.<BR><BR>4) My least favorite thing about HI1 are the pellets. I would rather have to deal with 'natural' horses that can't be changed than have changing as an option and be stuck with the residue counter. My least favorite things about HI2 were the chat system, the lack of whisperer, and the competitions. The chat system is absolutely ridiculous, especially for a game that is 'PG'. A lot of the words we use are nonsense, I understand the necessity of the filter but a lot of the words you can't say aren't any form of inappropriate. <BR><BR>5) I basically answered my reasons for disliking HI2 repeatedly throughout the answers for the other questions. The chat system is bogus, the competitions aren't enjoyable, maybe because I'm so set on only doing SJ on HI1, but whatever. I like the idea of being able to see the wilds instead of just wandering over them on HI1. But I also would rather have a subscription system like HI1, to make all players able to buy/sell.<BR><BR>That being said, if HI3 is more like HI2 than HI1, I will probably not play at all.  <BR><BR>Thank you guys so much for taking our opinions into consideration. Hopefully with all of our input we can contribute to a new game and make it enjoyable for all of us.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Tesla)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 26 2018 4:57pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I love your idea about one-time breeding, Lacuna. It would keep a lot of diversity, as opposed to having an eternal horse being able to have many foals, and players would have to make a difficult decision about what horses to match, since they've only got one shot. I also think that players would be more emotionally invested (we're lame, I know) in the offspring since it's out of one or two of their favorite horses.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Supra)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 26 2018 5:50pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>1) I definitely prefer eternal horses.

I don't have a favourite part about HI2 as I've never really gotten into it.<BR><BR>4) My least favourite part about HI1, I'd have to agree with a lot of previous replies, would be the pellets. It seems like everyone and their dog has 100ers now, where they used to be rare. <BR>My least favourite part about HI2 is how restricting it was without a sub, and how confusing it was. I was never able to get into, where I found HI1 super easy to grasp.<BR><BR>5) I started playing HI1 basically when it came out. As I said previously, I always found HI2 too confusing. I have tried to play it/get into it a few times, but I'm just not about spending money on a game that I'm not even sure I like yet in order to experience a large majority of its features. Overall, I love HI1, and I'll definitely miss it when its no longer around.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Phantom)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 26 2018 6:04pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>1. I mean, I like the fact that horses live forever, but I think it would be interesting to have one server be lifetime horses, or you can pellet a horse to be immortal (but don't make it super difficult to achieve). <BR>2. Horse improvement, Competitions, Quests, are really the only things I do.<BR>3. I like the competitions and how the quests are easily doable. I don't mind the questing. The one thing I loved most about HI2 when I played it was the coloring variations of the horses. <BR>4. My least favorite thing about HI1 is the chat system. Most players are adults and us getting flagged for stupid words is ridiculous. I think there should be no filter, unless they are under 16. HI2 I found was just very difficult to get into because the economy is awful and hard to make money.<BR>5. I hate the chat system for HI2 and the fact that it was so hard to get anything remotely done. I also want the sub system of HI1.

I think Breeding them is more fun, since I dont really have time anymore to do competitions. Maybe a mixture? Either like Howr se where you can make a horse immortal, or as simple as an option. When you have a horse you can set it (by a certain age maybe) so that you cannot breed it, and it boosts its competition stats? That way those who want to go for highest exp horse can go for that, while those who like to breed for colors, can do that?<BR><BR>2) Gameplay: Chat is a big one for me, then the following: Wild Horse Hunting, Horse Improvement, Puzzles, NPC/Quests, Ranch Building, Adventure Gathering, and then competition.

Eternal would be a great idea. As much as we do wish we have the time to consistently play horseisle, many of us do have periods of time where we are just so busy that we tend to miss out on our horseisle time. (i.e. finals period etc). It would be quite sad if we were to come back to our favourite horses having passed on. As someone who plays HI1 and have tried her hand at both ET and LC on HI2, I would really prefer HI1's 'eternal horse' function.<BR><BR>2. First would definitely be chat. I don't know if I can say this for all the players, but the main reason I keep coming back to this game is because of the buddies I've made on this game. Being able to chat with them and to basically not be limited to talk about almost everything was a big aspect of what actually kept me on this game. HI2 was a big no for me as I was unable to chat freely with my friends and use the slang or even call them nicknames as they were filtered by the chat. Secondly, NPC/Quests. As much as people don't like to quest to be able to get something, this was another way I can spend time with buds, trying to figure out the quests together. The rest would go as follows: Adventure Gathering, Wild Horse Hunting, Competition, Puzzles, Ranch Building, Crafting and Horse Improvement.<BR><BR>3. My favourite part of HI1 would most probably be the quests and also the simplicity of the overall game play. The fact that it was not too complicated and that most things were pretty straightforward. HI2 was too intense for me in general.<BR><BR>4. My least favourite part about HI2 would be the fact that there are so many/similar quest items. It constantly seems like its overwhelmed in my inventory and I would always forget what is needed. Another thing would most definitely be the chat. Another thing would also be the way we maneuver on HI2. I would prefer just moving up down left right, instead of being able to move with multiple arrow keys at a time. <BR><BR>5. The main reason I stayed with HI1 was because of its simplicity. The fact that UTs are so easily calculated and that horses were not based off like a 5-scale thing.

However, including breeding, where the foal could age into an adult, then live forever would be a cool edition. Or even just breeding for different coats and they’d automatically be an adult. Just some sort of breeding while also being eternal would give it that extra appeal instead of having one or the other. <BR><BR>2) My order would be - Competitions, horse improvement, quests, wild horse hunting, ranch building, adventure gathering, Crafting, Puzzles and chat. <BR><BR>3) Favorite part of the games - Competitions and seeing how much exp I can get on my horses.<BR><BR>4) my least favorite part of the games - Considering competitions is my favorite part my least favorite  is basically how the competitions are on both games, hi1 only esj runs which is fine, but the experience gain is very small and the length it takes for the competitions to start is slow, hi2 on the other hand a few different competitions run fine and the competitions start faster but  because of the daily bonus, competitions don’t fill very well making it hard to experience your horses, because the most popular seems to be jockey and reining so if those bonuses barely come around, you’ll never get much exp done. So an improved competition system would be super amazing. <BR><BR>5) If you only play HI1, what was the reason you stayed here instead of playing HI2? Basically my answer is the same response for number 4, I play the game to experience my horses and hi1, esj is almost always running and hi2, the competitions don’t run nearly as much which made me uninterested in playing.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by FlashOfHope)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 27 2018 3:16pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Judging from the amount of comments being deleted, I assume when it was said &quot;need some help from you&quot; and &quot;answer some questions&quot;, what you really meant was &quot;Confirm what we already plan to do, because any different opinions will be deleted so we can continue make sure that those with the same opinions as us beleive their opinions matter.&quot;? <BR><BR>Aunt correct amiright?</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Pompeii)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 27 2018 3:55pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>1.

Socialization on HI2 is a chore. Language is constantly evolving, and we need a chat system that allows the language of the game to grow with the terminology people are actually using. Forced spellings also make socialization inaccessible to those who may not be wholly proficient in English. I much prefer HI1’s chat system; I think the chat system should allow for colloquial speech while filtering out inappropriate words.<BR><BR>5) I play both HI1 and HI2, but I strongly prefer HI1. It mostly comes down to the socialization aspect. HI2 has some excellent features, but there’s no beating how easy it is to use the chat system on HI1. I don’t have to worry about having to retype my sentence five different times because I keep missing a typo, or can’t use a certain contraction or popular colloquial term.

Could there possibly be a &quot;breeding&quot; type of thing were the progeny inherits some of the structure withholding water and sires stats, but is obviously a horse when it's born as horses won't age? *laughing out loud!*. <BR><BR>2) Please order in your preference of gameplay mechanic, favorite first: <BR><BR>Competition, Chat, Horse hunting, horse improvement, adventure, ranch building, quests, craft, puzzles<BR><BR>3) Briefly, what is your favorite part of HI1/2? <BR><BR>Whispering and training<BR><BR>4) Briefly, what is your least favorite part of HI1/2? <BR><BR>Grinding out finding quest items<BR><BR>5) If you only play HI1, what was the reason you stayed here instead of playing HI2? <BR><BR>I didn't like the gameplay, it was too choppy and far too difficult to learn.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Desertmorn)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 28 2018 5:12am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>1) Prefer no breeding and that horses do not die.<BR><BR>2) NPC/Quests, Puzzles, AdventureGathering, Chat  <BR><BR>3) HI1 - questing <BR><BR>4) Briefly, what is your least favorite part of HI1 - horse improvement<BR><BR>5) HI2 gameplay was too complicated, and visually difficult for me due to lack of eye coordination - I got dizzy too easily.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by CookieDough)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 28 2018 8:26am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>1) preferably eternal<BR><BR>2) Chat, Competition, WildHorseHunting, HorseImprovement,Puzzles,AdventureGathering, NPC/Quests, Crafting<BR><BR>3) Favorite part of HI1- whispering and simplicity <BR><BR>4) Least favorite part of HI2- chat filter <BR><BR>5) If you only play HI1, what was the reason you stayed here instead of playing HI2? chat filter, and the simplicity</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Corolla)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 28 2018 10:30am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>1) Eternal is nice because of the fact that if I want to take a hiatus, I can come back and all my ponies will be safe and sound (minus a few stats..) At the same time, I really like breeding mechanics in games. I find genetics super interesting!

I don't feel so lonely, even though there's only like, 20 people on most of the time. It's simpler to play and nostalgic for me since I began when I was much much younger *laughing out loud!*. I keep trying to get into HI2 but for some reason just can't get into it. It's hard to get started and it seems like a lot of the mechanics are just so complicated and I just don't have the patience for it all.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 28 2018 12:09pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Deleted a post as it contained content that is not allowed to be discussed on HI.

HI1 was (and still is) a big part of my life.<BR><BR>2) CUSTOMIZATION. CHAT. HorseImprovement. NPC/Quests. AdventureGathering. WildHorseHunting. Competition. RanchBuilding. Competition. Crafting. Puzzles. <BR><BR>3) i love the community created in HI1. the friends and memories i've made because of it are invaluable. the customization is also a big draw.  <BR><BR>4) in HI2, i appreciated being able to ride your horse and having the more 3D aspect, but honestly the social/community aspect is so restrictive i will not play it. i understand the need to make a game safe, but we also have to acknowledge that there's a digital language that's much different than our spoken language and heavily restricting the way we communicate is a big turn off. i'm all for filtering out inappropriate words, but there needs to be some leeway with the digital/chat/colloquial language that's used today.<BR><BR>5) i definitely prefer HI1 over HI2, mostly for the ease of communication. even though i like the 3D aspect of HI2, it honestly sometimes feels (graphics wise) lower quality than HI1. the zoom-in is TOO zoomed-in, the map is hard to read, and it doesn't really feel like a cohesive game. (plus all the chat restrictions that i already covered.) the horse's art is nice, but only when you're actually viewing the horse, not when you're riding it. <BR><BR>*) i'd like to say that i do like the idea of a one-time breeding or some other way to incorporate foals in the game without losing the eternal aspect that keeps me playing. <BR><BR>though i'll always be loyal to HI1, i'm excited to see where HI3 goes.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Fawn)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Apr 30 2018 10:17am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>1.

My favorite part of HI1/Eternal is the ability to train the horses and keep them forever. HI2 wise is the training contracts, daily exp at ranches given, and the ability to save up stat points to train later on. Sometimes we're not always able to get to a PC to hop online so it's nice knowing our horses are still being trained and such. I also like the fact that horses don't lose stat points on eternal compared to HI1 if not trained for an extended period of time.Separate ranch islands are also amazing. <BR><BR>4. I -do not- like the fact that accounts don't time out on eternal. <BR><BR>5. I play HI1 more than I do eternal as I have more heart into HI1. It's a familiarity and time invested type deal.

Despite my dislike of how heavily filtered it gets (majority of us are now adults), I do like that you generally have the freedom to type how you wish. (So you can actually enthusiastically say &quot;Heeeeey&quot;, or make up silly words with no meaning etc. like giving buddies weird nicknames)<BR>- The relative simplicity<BR>- Not having to be a subscriber to do most things.<BR><BR>HI2:<BR>- The variability of horse coats. That is actually very cool and unique.<BR>- The amount of companions you can have- this too is pretty fun<BR>- The tack - love it<BR>^ So basically I LOVE the artwork on the horses/companions/tack etc. <BR><BR><BR>4) Briefly, what is your least favorite part of HI1/2? <BR><BR>For HI1:<BR>- The limited amount of spaces on the ranch.<BR>- The text limitation on horse descriptions.<BR>- Getting vios for accidentally misspelling words such as dang. Very annoying.<BR>- The fact that with adding more quests, it made it take wayy longer to get a certain amount of QP%. It would be nice to not have to literally do every single existing quest to get to 100%, so then some are optional but then people that have 100% qp can still enjoy doing new quests.<BR>- The QP rewards are all over the place. Some quests you go all over HI and craft stuff and get just 100QP. Whilst there are some that you barely do a thing and get 200QP or more.<BR><BR><BR>For HI2: <BR>- The chat filter is absolutely ridiculous in my opinion. It is horrible and for me was 100% the biggest turn-off. <BR>There is ZERO expressive freedom. I cannot speak the way I described in point 3. It makes chatting bland and completely not personal or fun. <BR>- ALSO (adding to the chat filter complaint) the fact that you have to spell all things perfectly is really frustrating for dyslexic people. You shouldn't have to be great at spelling to be able to socialise.<BR>Not everyone has English as their first language either, might I add, making the game much less playable/fun/attractive to non-native English speakers.<BR>- The font of the text. The font and size were unpleasant (yes I am nit-picking but for me it was annoying) <BR>- Having to subscribe to be able to do pretty much ANYTHING. 2nd biggest turn-off for me.<BR><BR><BR>5) If you only play HI1, what was the reason you stayed here instead of playing HI2? <BR><BR>- Chatting with my buds. On HI2, again, the chat filter is just so aggravating. Lack of freedom of expression drove me away and kept me on HI1.<BR>- It is simple, but not overly simple. <BR>- The lay-out: it isn't a huge massive screen in your face nor is it tiny. There is no overload of buttons etc and the font is pleasantly readable.<BR>- Personal Profiles are a pleasant font and the letters arent huge in your face.<BR>- You don't have to be a subscriber to do things.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Hector)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>May 3 2018 6:51am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>1) <BR><BR>It is important to me that the horses are eternal and do not die.

Eternal for me.<BR><BR>2)Before I say anything, I don't know if it's something you guys would be open to doing, but something that annoyed me about HI2 was that talking with friends was definitely slowed down due to the fact that each word had to be a real word, and sometimes we have typos on HI1 but atleast the chat goes out quick. I just liked the way the chat was a lot more on HI1 but I know people go around the filter so I understand if you would want it more like HI2.<BR><BR>As far as question number 2, I would say Wild Horse Hunting, Competition, Chat, Ranch Building, Horse Improvement, Quests, Adventure Gathering, Puzzles, Crafting.<BR><BR>Also something to add in, I also liked Horse Hunting in the wild on HI1 better. I know a lot of people are mixed about it, but I really like the whole Idea of the whisperer on HI1.<BR><BR>3) Favorite part of HI1 would probably be the simplicity... I don't know... it seems weird but i've grow up on this game and I still enjoy it as an adult just as much as I did when i was a child. Besides that I really enjoy Simple Jump and whispering. Also really liked everyone being able to see where your ranch was. I just named fifty things so that probably defeated the point. In regards to HI2 I really liked all the extra stuff that was added, which probably goes against me liking how HI1 was simple but oh well. I also very much liked the extra ranch additions, pretty much having your own island.<BR><BR>4) Not sure there was anything I really disliked about HI1. HI2 seemed to get a little boring for me sometimes, finding horses was frustrating for me because it took 3589238579 minutes just to get from one side of a huge island to another, but my friends had an easier time finding horses than me. Other than that, I didn't play it enough to have other valid points.<BR><BR>5) I kept staying with HI1 but occasionally going to HI2 when I was annoyed with HI1, but that was not very often. I really only went to HI2 when friends were on from HI1.

I tend to start collections of horses that I absolutely love and refuse to sell (many of which I have had for several years). If they happened to age and eventually die, that would really discourage me from playing. If that means that there is no breeding in game, so be it. It definitely outweighs losing some of my favourite horses after a specific amount of time.<BR><BR>2) Chat is definitely the most important. I personally feel like HI3 should be mainly modeled after HI1, as most of us lean toward the original game compared to the second version. I know several of the other players have joined HI2, but we don’t necessarily like the format/lag. I feel that keeping all of the aspects we have on here compared to HI2, but perhaps amping it up a little bit, would be super nice. <BR><BR>3) I personally love the whispering, the community aspect, and the nostalgia that HI1 offers. Many of us have forged pretty tight friendships over the years here. HI1 has always been an escape and fun place to come to at the end of the night or during the day when I manage to catch a break.  For HI2, the artwork is fantastic. I really appreciate the variations of coat colours that they have over there compared to our limited set on here.<BR><BR>4) My least favourite part of HI1 is the chat restrictions. I know that many (if not all) current players started out younger/as children, but we are all late teens and up at this point. I feel that we should have a more open chat, though I would understand if some things were still monitored like bullying/super explicit content. Then again, that’s why we have the mute button. Same thing goes for HI2, the chat absolutely blows. Also, having to be subbed to basically do anything is a huge drawback. The fact that you can’t whisper horses and have to wait a minute or so after attempting (and failing) to catch a horse is also incredibly annoying.<BR><BR>5) I only play HI1. I have given HI2 many shots over the years and I just can’t get into it. I don’t like the layout. It’s super complex and overwhelming. While HI1 is MUCH simpler and 2D, I don’t think any of us mind that. I actually prefer the way it looks to HI2 because there is just so much going on and I feel like I get lost in it all. I would like to get some newer art/features that HI2 has for HI3, but I would want it to meet somewhere in the middle. HI2 is too big and has too much going on. HI1 is simple, and I love it, but if we could just implement more breed colours/etc like HI2 has that would be fabulous. The lag on HI2 is also horrendous – even on a newer laptop. <BR><BR>I also TOTALLY agree with Khaleesi about holding our usernames for us. That would be a wonderful feature if able to be implemented.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Luci)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>May 5 2018 6:46am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>1) I would very much like to keep the eternal horses.

The nostalgia, the simplicity, the art, the community, the way it feels like horse-pokemon, its a pure game which doesn't feel real-money based, you can easily play here with in-game money. And<BR>the wild horse catching. Whispering is my favourite activity to do and if HI3 has a good way to whisper and catch wild horses, I would definitely play that for years.<BR><BR>4) Briefly, what is your least favorite part of HI1? <BR>The navigation, how fast your avatar moves. Least favourite about HI2 would be how it's not as easy to catch wilds.<BR><BR>5) If you only play HI1, what was the reason you stayed here instead of playing HI2? <BR>HI2's lack of global chat really was a killer for me when I tried it. I felt pretty alone and when I did try and branch out I didn't like the community, as theres no global community the abundance of 'cliques' and 'groups' was too much. Also, there was no whisperer so I would look for hours for ponies and not get much from it for my time.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by SleepyCat)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>May 10 2018 9:08pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I'm really late to the party, but heres my <BR><BR><BR>1) Is the fact that there is no breeding and that horses do not die important to you? <BR>I only play HI1 so this doesn't really matter to me, but eternal would give me more time with the horse to put more time and effort into it rather than it expiring and all my efforts going along with it. <BR><BR>2) Please order in your preference of gameplay mechanic, favorite first:<BR><BR>Chat, Wild horse hunting, ranch building, horse improvement, competitions, NPC/Quests, adventure/gathering, puzzles, crafting.<BR><BR>3) Briefly, what is your favorite part of HI1/2? <BR>Favourite part of HI1: simplicity, 2D gameplay.

Life gets busy and I am a single-track-focuser.   We switched to a big project on building a local non-profit community workshop in our home town. That is where 110% of my time and effort has gone the last three years, scraping paint and helping folks learn laser engraver, etc.   A while back I made a big effort to help improve the economies of HI but the drama was overwhelming.  We made some improvements,  but anything we tweak on a long established game can cause more problems than solve.  For those reasons, with many people not appreciating, and lack of time, it is safer to just leave well enough alone.<BR><BR>Per complaints about the violations system, we never allowed anyone to false claim.  All reports are fact-checked. the Actual chat logs are reviewed,  the actual transactions are looked at.  no one can make stuff up.  In fact players can earn violations for filing false reports. Nothing can be 100% perfect,  but is simply not as wild west as some of the claims.  <BR><BR>That said, now I'm committed to HI3.  Since first of January, 2018 I have done *Nothing* but sit and work on it.  We've recently even hired an additional full time programmer, several artists and a genetics expert.  I am working 70-80 hours a week on our beloved universe.  To those that try to make a claim of us not caring,  you are incorrect. However, even with my huge time and effort commitment, these things take time.  Lots of time.  I spent 2.5 years of 80 hour weeks to launch HI2.   I hope to focus on essentials and get a playable base that we can expand on after release, but even that will likely take until the end of this year for beta.  I cannot spend much time updating the progress as it's usually impossible to properly explain something without a full time publicist person, and instead may lead to false conclusions and disappointment.  But, know that we are working Hard, and are taking lessons learned from HI1/2.  <BR><BR>Will do some news postings soon!<BR>Thanks!</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Elanor)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>May 14 2018 2:25am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Super excited, Jor!

Everything about it. I love the chat and how much easier it is to talk than on HI2. I really prefer the colors of the chat and the fonts as well on HI1. They're really overbearing on HI2, and being someone who is extremely affected by colors (weird, right?) it was a MAJOR turn off to have to deal with the colors on HI2. I also really liked how on HI1, you don't have to be subbed to do things, except to buy a ranch.<BR><BR>4) Briefly, what is your least favorite part of HI1/2? <BR><BR>I didn't like the travel on HI1, at least to get to different islands. I guess I'm just spoiled with the unipeg. I didn't like that we couldn't see a person's profile and horses if they weren't online. I also really, really hate that the breeds keep being redone. Every time I see a &quot;This breed is redone&quot; update, I get so scared! I LOVED some of the older styles of the breeds, now they look too shiny and fake.<BR>In HI2, I really didn't care for the animation too much. I liked the realism of the horses in HI1. As I said before, I didn't like the colors.

I'm so familiar with the towns and NPC's that I have muscle memory for going to different isles. I LOVED the older animation of the horses. I like how simple it is. I like the colors of the chat and how they used a thin font. I liked that it was 2D. I liked the way everything looked. I liked how easy it was to get into buildings and not having to wait extra amount of time or lag out. I liked being able to talk to my friends on the buddy chat and not be extremely restricted.

Cause I threw out my back, am maybe slightly dopey, and have had 6 cups of coffee. Some basic answers on questions would be great...don't think I am asking anything too huge. Mostly just some random thoughts on ideas that I think would be great. Mostly just consider it spitballing some ideas I suppose.<BR><BR><BR>&quot;Buy an actual, large plot of land in the world and build your ranch&quot; Does this mean full customization? Like if I want a barn and house painted white with pink glitter trim, I can have a princess house and barn?(Used those colors, because my kid watches me play and would LOVE to help pick colors, and that is what she would choose.) I know I would LOVE to build and customize my ranch so it is 100% my own. I don't wanna find another 100% like it.<BR>Sizes of buildings would naturally have base sizes, but it would be awesome if we could pick our paint colors. Really make it our own.<BR><BR>If done as &quot;Client Download&quot; will it be a purchase or a free download? If I have to buy the game AND pay for subscription, I'd rather see a &quot;Buy the game get X amount of game money, first horse of choice, and first month subscription as a trial&quot; type thing. I know a lot of the HI1 players seem upset that its going to have a lot of the HI2 feel. I personally like HI2 better. I play HI1 still for my love/hate relationship with the whisperer. I would be thrilled if it were all HI2 with the whisperer. But the others, not so much. If it came with a free fully loaded trial with purchase of the download, they could see how they like the game fully loaded. Plus, you still make a profit from all who buy the download, if that is the route you are taking(Which from a business standpoint, does seem logical).<BR>All who like the game can keep playing for free, or continue subscribing.<BR><BR>Also, could you explain the &quot;Club will be central&quot; bit? Does this mean I will HAVE to be in a club? That I will HAVE to socialize? Cause I will admit...I have 4 people I talk to. I'm not the most social creature out there. 100% Mare Stare type socialization skills. I don't wanna have to socialize with people if I don't want to. I'll happily pay club fees, just please leave me alone. xD<BR><BR>Now, I didn't see much on the chat side which is concerning. Because despite being as social as a hungry grizzly bear out looking for a uhh...new friend...I do enjoy chatting with my select few long time buds. I would love to see some changes in the chat department. Obviously nothing graphic, swearing, inappropriate topics, but I still say, if kept in PM, if one of my buds says &quot;Go see the pic I sent you(Here on this other site) of what my kid/pet got themselves into&quot; that it shouldn't get us in trouble. Maybe keep links out, but allow the words, especially since most of your players are now over 18 and have kids of their own. We have developed some real friendships through Horseisle. And we all are friends outside of HI now anyway. Kinda found a way around that rule years ago, even though no one mentions it to &quot;The powers that be&quot;. Ya know, Its the little things that go a long way. This is a BIG one for me. Because the few real friends I've made here...we all have kids. We do like to send each other pictures. And if its sent online and we are playing HI instead of elsewhere, a quick &quot;Hey, go check _____!&quot; would be nice to be accepted without getting vios/banned. Keep the rest of chat the same if need be, but please allow some of the little things that are apart of everyday life. (We all know the powers that be are on social media. We have found your profiles. :P )<BR><BR>Also...as people who have been paying you guys for YEARS now...maybe really get us involved.<BR><BR>I know here and there you ask us about thoughts on some big stuff, but otherwise we are not a part of the family. Which stinks as someone who has been here since ya'll opened.<BR><BR>We have a community of really talented players that would LOVE to be involved in the game in depth. I've seen some truly amazing artwork by our own players. Maybe when working on a new breed, send out a contest. &quot;This is the breed/pet we want. Send in your best drawing of said breed/pet and our artist will make it come alive.&quot; Or even &quot;We need some new quest ideas. Send us a cool story line that we can work into a quest.&quot; Or even &quot;Hey, we need a new house for a new NPC, here is a brief description of what our new friend needs.&quot; <BR><BR>It gets us involved and would really help show that we DO matter. It would let us be a part of the game, instead of just being a paycheck. Obviously, your own staff would still be required to do tweaking to stuff, but still. We would be a part of the game. Can you imagine the joy of coming on after an update and realizing something that came from YOU was in a game? That would be absolutely amazing.<BR><BR>That is something that several players would absolutely love. I'm no artist, but I've had a lot of life events that would make for some hilarious quests. Obviously I'd leave out my grandmother kidnapping me when I was 6(Which I thought was just a super fun road trip...I mean I got to sit up front of a police car, play with the sirens, talk on the radio, and other super cool stuff for a 6 year old while my mom traveled 6 states to come get me.) but I have tons of other life events that would require some changed britches if done before a restroom trip. And I know, I am not the only one. <BR><BR>I am not a quester by any means. I frequently tell people &quot;Questing is against my religion.&quot; Or...if I HAVE to quest, &quot;Forgive my potty mouth...but I am going to...quest...&quot;. I HATE questing. Mostly because a lot of the quests are pretty boring to me. &quot;So and so needs you to bring her this.&quot; But a funny story to tell me WHY so and so needs popcorn, maple syrup, and feathers....I'd probably look forward to it. &quot;Oh boy. Hershal's neighbor keeps playing ding dong ditch with him. He needs a bucket of syrup, some feathers, string, and some popcorn. Better help him out so he can set his trap.

Eternal horses is critical for me. For me, training and competing a horse becomes kind of pointless if you know the horse is going to die. <BR><BR>2. Chat, Horse improvement, Competition, Wild horse hunting, Ranch building, NPC/Quests, Adventure gathering, Puzzles, Crafting<BR><BR>3. My favorite part of HI1 is the chat system. I love having my specific buddy chat and also a global chat for everyone that is online. Honorary mention goes to rapid travel via uni/peg and the simplicity (ease of understanding) of the competitions. <BR><BR>4. Least favorite part of HI1 is that once you had accomplished &quot;enough&quot; quests and/or had &quot;enough&quot; money, there wasn't really anything to do besides compete your horses and accumulate money. <BR><BR>Also, I know this will be highly unpopular with other HI1ers, but when the pawneer prices were increased, whispering became VERY profitable even if you caught all fails, and as a result there was an insane demand for it and the law of averages dictated many more &quot;quality&quot; horses were caught than before so much whispering occurred, devaluing the market. And, since there wasn't really anything else to do (back to point #1), many people camped out and whispered for hours. I think it ruined the value of finding wild horses. <BR><BR>5. So I have played HI1 since 2008 and tried both Eternal and LC when HI2 was released. There were several reasons I ended up not staying with either HI2, including: <BR><BR>- Not able to do anything without a sub, like trade with other players or buy horses in auctions; made it very difficult to try the game and become invested enough to pay real money<BR><BR>- No global chat; there was never any real sense of community to me, I never felt connected to other players playing like I did on HI1<BR><BR>- Hated (absolutely HATED!) that you couldn't view everyone online and see their profile/horses without either being near them or !VIEWing it. I was new and just wanted to see what other people were up to and it was annoying. There was nothing wrong with HI1's system of seeing everyone online and viewing profiles and horses. <BR><BR>- Inventory and carry system was too complex; I often found myself overweight or overburdened and never had a sense of what exactly that meant and the minimal action needed to be able to ride my horse again<BR><BR>- Arenas felt impossible to do well in without expensive tack I didn't have as a newbie (unlike HI1's simple jumping, where you can do decently even without the most expensive tack)<BR><BR>Things I did like in HI2 over HI1:<BR><BR>- The graphics were objectively much better, I love the simplistic charm of HI1 but I also liked HI2's graphics including the more varied horse color system<BR><BR>- Liked that the game kept track of what quests had been started and a brief summary of where you left off. <BR><BR>- Liked the system of &quot;finding&quot; items in the world by seeing them on the screen and then clicking (pick or whatever) and seeing them go away, versus HI1 just seeing them on the ground and not having any visual, which made looking for them very hard.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Theran)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>May 17 2018 6:50am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>1) I hate the idea of horses dying. So yeah, the whole &quot;breeding&quot; element proposed in HI3 just makes me annoyed. I feel like this will just devalue horses. LC went downhill once people realised you could just cross breed and obtain new breeds with high stats in legit 2-3 generations. Which became extremely annoying and moot point of adding new breeds when you could just cross breed and have a +150 in no time.<BR><BR>2) Chat, Competition, Horse Improvement, Wild Horse Hunting, Ranch Building, Adventure Gathering, Puzzles, NPC/Quests.<BR><BR>3) What briefly is your favorite part of HI1/2? <BR>The nostalgia. And also the unique system. <BR><BR>4) What briefly is your least favorite part of HI1/2? <BR>The lack of advertising to encourage new players which saw the game die after 3-4 years and the silly over the top filter. If you're going to have LC as +16 to play, are you going to do the same for HI3 and therefore adjust the filter accordingly? I'm not saying to allow cuss words etc, but it really limits the game if you're going to maintain a filter suitable for 8 year olds when the majority of the game is played by those who are of older teenage or adult age. Especially if the &quot;breeding and dying&quot; aspects of LC warrant stating its recommended for players 16 and over? I also hate the idea of breeding and horses dying in LC and the ease of breeding high skill horses once these exist in the game. Thats why I left LC.  <BR><BR>5) Other thoughts? <BR>Please consider lifetime subs and making the purchasable elements of the game more affordable by having flash sales etc. Also, increasing your advertising to advertise on platforms that you refuse to acknowledge exist. You *know* the ones I'm talking about. Other horse games have grown their bases so hugely and become multi million dollar companies through effective advertising. There is such a demand for unique, interactive horse games. If you advertise it on these platforms, you are going to make so much more money and attract a much wider player base than if you don't. If HI2 LC has a minimum age of 16 to play, I don't see how utilising these platforms to advertise is going to cause harm because your past excuses centred around young players and not wanting to expose them to these platforms etc. Advertising = more players = more money. This money could be used to create the most amazing game and employ full time staff to take the stress of you guys. Because you all did a lot to create this. So create the game that allows you guys as game owners to sit back and relax a bit and have employees take over. After all, you *do* put in a lot of time and I can tell you guys love this game as much as we all do. If you didn't, you wouldn't be trying to make a third.<BR>And now, my final point: How are you going to show the players you can finally future proof a game? I hate to be rude, but HI1 died off after a few years, then you brought in HI2, which did the same after a few years. Now, both eternal and HI1 suffer really low regular player numbers and the games are essentially at a stasis with updates. And now with the whole flash player thing, what will you do to make sure this game continues on for as long as it can without having drawbacks experienced in the current games? For example, the whole way outdated flash system you use to draw and animate the horses/pets/tack/etc in for HI1 and the lack of ability to find people who can use it and create content? I grew up on this game. Little 11 year old me who got her mum to make her an account and only able to play for 10 minutes a day.

It’s so nice to look back at a horse that you’ve had since first joining as well as having a reason to keep training to get to the top. It would be very disappointing to have a horse that you love and have gotten attached to only to log on one day to see that it died. I like the idea of breeding and wouldn’t be opposed to it, but I would also be perfectly OK with having a HI1 system of eternal-only horses. <BR><BR>2) <BR>Chat, WildHorseHunting, NPC/Quests, AdventureGathering, HorseImprovement, Puzzles, Competition, Crafting, RanchBuilding<BR><BR> I personally prefer a more adventure style game which is why I like the quests and horse hunting so much. I could spend all day running around exploring, questing, and looking for wilds especially if it were a 3D environment. <BR><BR>3) <BR>HI1: The art, questing system, chat, and whispering<BR>HI2: CUSTOMIZATION, variety in horse colors/patterns, and the music. I love the nostalgic HI1 music but I would be lying if I said that I didn’t love the HI2 music even more. <BR><BR>4) <BR>HI1: Lack of customization/variety in horse colors, the economy (cmon, it’s kinda annoying when the only horses being bought/sold are the “top” ones for hundreds of millions)<BR>HI2: Chat filter (please oh please keep the HI1 chat filtering system, we’re basically all 20+ adults), lag, the fact that you needed a sub to to much of anything <BR><BR>5) <BR>The main thing that kept me coming back to HI1 was the nostalgic feel and how easy/simple the game was to get into. Having immortal horses is also very important to me as life gets hectic and I can’t afford to play every day making sure my horse is even still alive. I played HI2 every now and then but due to the chat filtering and lack of a community at the momentosphere I got bored and lonely very quickly, and only spent about half an hour on a time running around looking for wilds. The questing in HI2 is alright, but the game itself was just too complex. <BR><BR>PERSONAL NOTES: These are just extra thoughts that I had while answering but I didn’t wanna end up with 3 paragraph long answers.<BR><BR>*In regards to lag, I’d be super careful with the 3D idea since 3D games tend to lag even more. The lag in HI2 was a big turn off especially on the bigger isles because there was so much to load, and a lot of us casual players don’t have a fancy gaming pc. I like the 3D idea but to keep it cartoonish/stylized, similar to World of Warcraft as that’s the only game my desktop can even run with good frames. <BR><BR>*Wild horses that you can actually see; as exciting as it is to stumble across a random wild in HI1, it was a bit annoying having to search pixel by pixel for a whispered horse vs. in HI2 where you can actually see it.<BR><BR>*I do like how there aren’t really any micro transactions on HI1/2, and would love to see the same for HI3. Micro transactions have made games unenjoyable for me since not everyone can drop a lot of money on cosmetics/stat increases. <BR><BR>*Please make customization a big factor in HI3; customization is what really immerses a person into a game and is what makes them feel like they’re actually “there”. This can mean even having a simple character creation system at the beginning where you can make your character and your first horse to get you started. <BR><BR>*Day/night/weather system</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by ElectricSheep)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>May 20 2018 8:02am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>*lack of community at the momentosphere; I love autocorrect *laughing out loud!*</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Teemo)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>May 20 2018 7:28pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>1) I think it's very important that there's no breeding.

It was better when I first played in 2008 than it is now, but that's likely due to the fact that way fewer people play HI1 now compared to 10 years ago. One constant thing I've noticed is that players will act immature/petty or disrespectful towards others, and I barely ever use the game's social features because of this.<BR><BR>5) I tried making an account on HI2 a couple of years ago, but wound up quitting.

You wouldn't believe how many couldn't and wouldn't play if there wasn't a chat filter. I also am very fond of the fact that you're able to ride your horse. I have -tried- to play games that you're not able to literally enter a world and ride your horse , but it became so monotonous that I gave up and never came back again. <BR><BR><BR>4) The graphics could be improved upon , in HI1. I'm not very happy with the way wild horse hunting is set up , because , unlike HI2 , you can't see the wild horse before you just walk across it! So , that makes wild horse hunting 10X harder. XD No offense but I like seeing the horse before I walk into it. More of a chance of finding one , you know!I also think that the non subs limits are a little on the extreme side. It is hard for the players to play when there are so many things that they can't do. (I posted on Eternal Game Forums more about that subject , so I really don't want to re-post the whole long thing again here *laughing out loud!*) <BR><BR><BR>5)I am a big fan of HI , and I am really looking forward to HI3. :) But , I had an idea , could we possibly be able to jump objects out-of-jumping-and-cross-country-arenas ? It is hard (on HI2) when , for example on Plains Isle , you want to get to the other side of the hedge on the side of the main path. You have to go all the way around them. :) So , XD I think there could be some lessons learned from HI1 &amp; HI2 , as far as improvements go. :) Thank you for your hard work , and I'm looking forward to HI3!

The horse profile and naming freedom, even though we have less space to work with I love being able to use [i,u,b,colors]. The pawneer, can't go wrong with being able to pawn horses you can't sell. The chat filter, the competitions and pretty much everything else with the first one. The only part I like about HI2 is that fact that instead of a &quot;train all&quot; ranch training, there's an option to allow your ranch to add exp to your horses every day without you having to be on and the customization option for playing character plus horses.<BR><BR>4) The new interest on HI1 is the only thing I don't like and for the most part I don't care for HI2, it lags way to much for my liking and I only go on out of boredom.

Eternal Horses vs Breeding is a big decision to be made. Please give a short answer of your preference. <BR><BR> - For me, eternal horses are a must. I'm not going to spend time/effort putting experience on a horse that is simply going to die in a few days.<BR><BR>2) Please order in your preference of gameplay mechanic, favorite first: <BR>Chat, Crafting, RanchBuilding, HorseImprovement, AdventureGathering, WildHorseHunting, Puzzles, NPC/Quests, Competition <BR><BR> - Competition, Chat, Horse Improvement, Wild Horse Hunting, Ranch Building, Puzzles, NPC/Quests, Crafting<BR><BR>3) Briefly, what is your favorite part of HI1/2? <BR><BR>- Favourite part of HI1: Simplicity. No over the top filters. Competition is easy. Talking to friends is easy. The game is very much chat-centric, which is a plus and is why most of us still play the game, to talk to our friends. I don't know how many times that I sat on HI1 not doing anything at all and just talking to people for HOURS on end simply because it's easy and enjoyable. <BR>- Favourite part of Hi2: All of the different colours, the fact that markings change, the fact that you can super horses so you get to pick at least what it looks like, if not the stats. I like the wild finding part of this game too. <BR><BR>4) Briefly, what is your least favorite part of HI1/2? <BR><BR>- For both: There's a bit that kind of bothers me. First, I don't like the fact that there's absolutely no advertising for the game, it's very simple to make ads and to deploy them - and the benefits outweigh the negatives. While the first little while you may be in the negative, with the amount of new players you get simply from advertising you'd be making a lot more money in the future. Second, I feel like a lot of our voices are not heard when updates are made or things are changed. For example: Nobody wanted Iberians to be redone when they were redone in HI1, not a single person asked for it and yet they were redone anyways. This also happened with the Irish Draughts on Hi2, nobody asked for their eyes to be &quot;fixed&quot; or anything of the sort - yet both of these things were went ahead with and done without asking a single player if they wanted it to change. (With this aside I REALLY liked the way you took our input for the redo of the Friesians, that was a plus in my books.) While it may be more effort to ask the players what they actually want - this is how you get a more successful and committed player-base rather than simply making decisions without any input from the players. Customers who feel heard and appreciated tend to be more loyal and will continue to come back and spend money as they feel like they are part of a family. For example - Pick 5 breeds you want to implement, take a vote, rank them 1 through 5 with 1 being the most wanted and 5 being the least wanted and implement them in that order, or something similar. Third, the filter system on HI2 is out of hand and much too extreme. This is probably going to be one of your most heard statements. However, I also don't think having an administrator going through and reading chats to be a viable way to make sure that players are following the rules. If you are implementing a filter system, make sure that anything someone can get a violation for goes through the filter. Bias is a very real thing - this can make the difference between no violations and multiple violations depending on the player, which it should not be. It should be based on the chat. Fourth, I agree with everything Theran said and give them a shoutout and would also like to state all of that at the end of this paragraph as well.<BR><BR>5) If you only play HI1, what was the reason you stayed here instead of playing HI2? <BR><BR>- Chat filters. Simplicity of competitions, nostalgia, eternal horses that have no exp limit, the &quot;difficulty&quot; of getting horses to 60k+ exp, some kind of challenges. <BR><BR>Personal: I really hope you guys take some of this (this entire thread, I mean) into consideration as it may make or break my relationship with Horse Isle if not. <BR><BR>Thanks for trying a HI3, hopefully I can get into it better than HI2.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>May 30 2018 1:04pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>The following is taken from the HI3 page which is available to players to look at if you wish:<BR><BR>Probably have similar chat filters, but hope to relax it when appropriate.

It was around the time of 2016 that I quit, simply because I saw that the game went a bit downhill with the lack of economic stability. After returning every few months or so to see how the game has advanced, I understand, now, why it's difficult to gauge a new user's interest and to ensure that he/she keeps playing. There is no stable money system that has been put in to ensure that everyone in the game gets a fair shot. Allow me to inquire as to why banks grant us interest, yet there are no taxes (which, like interest, would fluctuate depending on the player). By implementing this idea, the game could further educate younger players on what to expect in the real world when faced with these issues. Isn't the idea of the game to be, give or take, as realistic (/educational) as possible? If my taxing idea isn't plausible, then I suggest taking out interest altogether. I don't feel that it's fair that a wealthy player can rack up interest, while the newer players are struggling. <BR><BR>That being said, I might be the odd one out of the bunch, but I actually like that HI2 does not have a whisperer. I feel as though that gives each player an equal chance of finding a &quot;more valuable&quot; wild horse. It also ensures that more time will be invested in the game, because more time must be spent in order to find them. I believe that the game will have a higher appeal if the things that we, as a community, consider to be more valuable are harder to come across. <BR><BR>As a user that no longer plays either game, I would love to see these ideas implemented into HI3 so that I could find new love for a game that I previously have become disinterested in.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Dapples)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jun 6 2018 4:43pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>1) Is the fact that there is no breeding and that horses do not die important to you?

I've done the breeding/aging/dying thing on a few other games, and it gets tedious.

There's literally all the time in the world to work with them.<BR><BR>2) NPC/Quests, Wild Horse Hunting, Puzzles, Horse Improvement, Adventure Gathering, Crafting, Competition, Ranch Building, Chat<BR><BR>3) For HI1, I love all of the quests and the availability of wild horses. One of the only things I like about HI2 is the fact that you can look at your quests in progress. I have to copy things down in Notepad on HI1 so I don't forget what I'm doing if I quit before I'm done with my quest(s).<BR><BR>4) For HI2, I don't like how hard it is to find wild horses, how hard it is to actually get the character to move in the right direction, or how the buildings are. It's simpler in HI1, just click on the character's name and talk to them, instead of having to go into that little circle, then over to the character, then finally talk to them once you've found the right one.<BR><BR>5) Overall, I like how HI1 is set up. I've come and gone a few times over the years (my first profile was made back when I was in middle school, and I played for quite a few years before life got busy and it got deleted for inactivity), and I keep coming back because I like how things are arranged. Quests for whoever wants to do them, competitions if you want to compete, little puzzles if you're looking for a challenge...there's something that can appeal to anyone, and it's not something you'd need a guide just to figure out how to play.

At the moment the only reason I continue here is because of what I've achieved on the game, be it money, horses or anything else. Leaving all my hard earned horses and stuff will not be worth it, and I will not be able to get a start on HI3 due to aforementioned lack of time. So, any chance of some sort of ''redress'' for players from here? Sorry if this post makes no sense, I'm fast asleep.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Viktor)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jun 8 2018 12:44am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Some sort of loyalty bonus would be so nice.

Many of us have being playing for years now and we are all adults so it is frustrating to have such strict rules blocking our conversations. <BR>I don't like how isolating HI2 felt. The lack of global chats made you very alone when starting out and like you were the only one playing. It was frustrating to not view people like you do on HI1, or to talk as freely.

It should go by factual information from color genetics in horses.<BR>Horses are not eternal in real life and shouldn't be in a game. Everyone enjoys new toys and challenges.  One way to soften the blow is to age horses, i.e. horses become &quot;senior&quot; after 1 real year (or pick your time) at which time their max performance is not as good even though their stats can still be good. Horses can cross the rainbow bridge after being senior for some specific period of time, thus mentally preparing the player for the eventual. Having their progeny in your horse herd is a great way to remember the original.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by TrinaTrotnot)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Jul 6 2018 12:22pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>oops, P.S.<BR>I don't play HI2 because the colors are dull and muddy and depressing.  <BR>I would vote for simple graphics and staying away from complex 3-D (maybe limit it to certain areas like cave mazes). <BR>I'm afraid the additional computing power needed would make the game inaccessible to some and laggy for everyone.

My favorite part of HI2 is our profiles! I think that is super important. If we didn't have profiles, you couldn't really know what the player that you're considering adding is like. Profiles are a great way to get to know each other's personality. I also love the wide screen that covers the computer. It's not as eye straining as HI1.<BR><BR>4) My least favorite part of HI1 is the graphics and you can't &quot;fullscreen&quot; it. I additionally don't like the fact that you can't see a wild horse before you walk over it. It's so much harder to find them that way.<BR>My least favorite part of HI2 is the inflation. There is no way we should be able to sell sub tokens for such high prices as everyone is. The greed of some of the players is overwhelming. So, maybe for HI3, consider a price limit on some of the more valuable items. Specifically, tokens. Thank you!😊<BR><BR>5) HI3 is going to be great! I love 3-D games and I know this will be the best. PLEASE keep the chat filter. And maybe if possible, make it non-download? At least launch a web version, please. Thanks!

Eternal Horses vs Breeding is a big decision to be made. Please give a short answer of your preference. <BR><BR>Definitely eternal! It would be heartbreaking if I invested all of my time into something only to have it die a few days later. <BR><BR>I also think that it would be pretty cool if each player was able to breed two of their horses together once only (and once per pair) to achieve a single offspring that would be account bound.

It's very straight forward when you're getting into it, and the gameplay itself is very easy to get into. Not to mention that there is literally something for every player. I can't really name what exactly it is that I love so much about the game, but it's one of a kind. <BR><BR>4) Briefly, what is your least favorite part of HI1/2? <BR><BR>Primarily the chat restrictions. As many of the other players above have stated, (and as has been stated on the hi3 site) it's difficult to have a conversation some days as a majority of us are 18+. A little ease on this would go far in the appreciation category. <BR><BR>Secondly would be interest. I love the way that interest works in HI, and love that the new interest rates are essentially non existent, but for a new player in the economy it would be nice if there were a larger interest rate for say, a period of a week or so that builds up some money for them to be established. Either that or have an automatic &quot;Horseisle Welcome&quot; basket of sorts that has a default amount larger than the one we currently have and coordinates to a wild horse that would be willing to travel with you and account bound if so desired. <BR><BR>5) If you only play HI1, what was the reason you stayed here instead of playing HI2? <BR><BR>I did actually attempt to play HI2. Exactly once. <BR><BR>Everything was too much and too over the top. None of the charm that I loved about HI1 was present, and getting into the gameplay was essentially impossible. Also because I've been playing HI1 since its release in 2007! I wouldn't ever leave for anything.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=adminforumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by DesertPaint)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Sep 2 2018 12:24pm</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>Post deleted.<BR><BR>Please watch using all caps, it's considered shouting, and not really allowed... <BR><BR>Also, while it's a few months later for HI2 LC horses life span, it's still painful for those who invest a lot in horses whether emotionally or training, etc.  <BR><BR>It's why we have the 2 games/2 different ways to play. :) <BR><BR>It's already been stated HI3 will offer both ways. <BR><BR>Thankies.</FORUMTEXT></TD></TR><TR><TD class=forumpost><FORUMSUBJECT>REPLY:</FORUMSUBJECT> <FORUMUSER>(by Granny)</FORUMUSER> <FORUMDATE>Sep 10 2018 3:43am</FORUMDATE><BR><FORUMTEXT>I won't fill out a form, simply because everything is stated above.
