[ ] Think about adding characters: Unicorn, Zorro, Pegasus, Lone Ranger, Shadowfax, Hidalgo,
     BLack Beauty, Black Stallion, Misty of chincoteague, Seabiscuit, Manowar, Tornado,
     Fatty Lumpkin, Flicka, Mr Ed, Epona

Cooperative Games: Capture the flag? (bonsai)
                   Maze, need two people to get through it.
--------- PARENTAL CONTROL IDEAS --------------------------------------------
USer can set up an account,  and then a parental control account can be added.
This account can do the following:
  Set CHILDNOCHAT to Yes/No,  Which disables all chat to this player.

  Set playtimeper Multiple.  Every this many minutes, they get to play online,
  So, that effectively sets the following limits:
  1= unlimited
  2=12 hours per day
  3= 8 hours per day
  4= 6 hours
  6 = 4 hours
  8 = 3 hours
  12 = 2 hours
  16 = 1.5 hours
  24 = 1 hours
  48 = .5 hours

  playtime can store up to a MAX of double the multiple production.
  i.e.  If parent sets playtimeper to 16 - and child stays logged off 2 days, they will have 3 hours of playable time. (Actual time would be 3 hours and 11 muinutes! cause they would earn some playtime WHILE playing...)

  parental disable - temporarily disable the account.

  Art ROom Disable?  - dont allow art room use for player.

  Session logs?

-------- WORLD LAYOUT AND STANDARDIZATION ----------------------------------------

MONEY: 
   Objects should be standardized as Being worth 10x their REAL WORLD value.  
   i.e. bluejeans, maybe($30.00us)=$300 game

QUESTS:
  Please see detailed quest manual on top of Quest Editor!  
  
TIME PERIOD:
  No electricity, No Engines, No gadgets, loosely modeled after american west, but also a FEW modern 
  things will trickle in...  Say bluejeans?  Doubt they were around in pre-engine.   
  So this land is, Kind of Modern Day, BUT cutoff from all tecnological advances.
  I.E.  We use wagons for transport,  not trains. etc.

CHARACTERS:
  Unique Single First Named characters (a baby names site is great) for all characters EXCEPT storeowners
  Storeowners Two names, first name with last name relating to store:
   FISHING SHOP LASTNAMES: Jim Fisher, Jim Hook, Jim Bobber
   FOOD STORE LAST NAME EXAMPLES: Jim Applecore, John Fig, Jim Peel.
   VETS: Jim Sutre, Bob Stitch
   etc...

CONVERSATIONS:
 * Characters can give directions, etc.. But lets NOT have them Leave character and tell the player to "CLICK HORSES"
   or anythign game specific,  lets leave the characters completely in the game, (they do not know its a game)
 * Actions should be placed in ( )'s   Whether it's describing an action that took place, or allowing you to perform an action.
 * Allow a response to exit every chat point, don't leave them blank (pretend there is no exit button at bottom, because there may not be in future)

LOCATION DESCRIPTIONS:
   Descriptions should be First-person-this is what-you-see descriptive text
   Good Examples:
      * This building is a mess,  there are actually Anthills on the floors out of all the dust.. 
      * In looking at this Rock, you notice a Small Drawing, Looks like it's telling you to Dig?
      * This building looks like it's ready to collapse onto you..  whoever owns it must not take care of it.
   Poor Examples:
      * I see a rock and a tree here.  (dont use 'I')
      * BUY STUFF HERE (lets not command a player)
      * Small Rocks.  (Lets prefix it with "You See some small rocks.")
   HTML Formatting: <B>,<I>,<BR>
      Go ahead and use the following codes:
      to bold something just do it like <B>This</B> that was bolded.
      For Italics, Do <I>This</I>.
      And for new lines, use<BR>newline!
      Directions Example:
          %MAPD <B>NORTH:</B> Business District<BR><B>SOUTH:</B> Residential District      
   Formatting Guildelines:
      DOnt over use it,  Use it when structure will help the description..  I.e. A note text, Or Multiple items described, etc.   

BUILDINGS:  
   On average,  twice as many cabins as Shops per town.
   MOST(2/3rds) Cabins should have an NPC,  All Stores Should.
   All buildings should have description text.  describe what you see inside the building with a couple lines.   
   Most buildings should be spaced with one non-building tile between each

   CLothes shops:  One different set of clothing stocked per town.
   Equipment shops: One Set of saddle/bridle/pad per town
   Groomer Vary in quality from 500-1000

----------------TACK STANDARDIZATION AND IDEAS:------------------------------------------------------
BONUS's Range from 0-500  for saddle, 0-200 for pad & 0-300 for bridle
AND ONLY for strength,speed,endurance,conformation,agility,intelligence,personality
(the last 2 probably unused??)

The Most basic Gear will do nothing.  it is cheap,  and simply allows for riding/competitions.

More advanced gear should be priced as follows:
no bonus            =$500 saddle, $250 pad/bridle
bonus' of around 50 = $1,500
bonus' of around 100 = $2,000
bonus' of around 200 = $10,000
bonus' of around 300 = $100,000
bonus' of around 400 = $1,000,000
bonus' of around 500 = $10,000,000

example bonuses are 250 speed, 100 endurance,   lets price it roughly: 50k for speed +5k for endurance=$55k

Tack Ideas:
Simple Set = no bonus's


Simple    $5k saddle   3k bridle    2k pad    +10 in somethine
improved  $50k saddle  30k bridle   20k pad   +100 in something +50 something else
awesome   $500k saddle $300k bridle $200k pad  +300 in something  +150 something else
magical   $5M saddle  $3M bridle $2M pad       +500 in something +250 something else

==========================================RANCH SYSTEM THOUGHTS==============================
Ranch houses are scattered around the empty lands of horseisle.

Either a single tile?  Or a center tile with options to build out around it.
They have a set Value,  and then an Adjustable Market Value based on Number of open ranches?
A Subscribed player can Buy a ranch.  Once bought,  they can TItle it,  write adescriptions for it
and Even Decorate it. (generic FLash Background, allow positioning Couch, chair, painting, etc.)
These do nothing other than look cozy.

At your ranch house,  you can receive mail, and send mail
You can also Build new structures:

Training Pen:  Allows you to train one horse/for free/day 5 points in anything!
Barn: Allows you to Own 2 more horses!  in addition to base # of 3?
Shed: Allows you to store Items here. STORE button, and GRAB button.. 

Different ranches have a different number of expandable slots.
Some cheap ones only have 1.  so a player could only build a shed for instance.
Others could have All Around for a max of 7 buildings (need an entrance)
    that would allow 3 barns (6+3 horses) 2 trainers and 2 sheds for lotsa junk

example ranch layout: H=house, B=barns, Shed,Trainer
BSS
BH===
BTT
Once built, a building can be torn down, but only 1/4 cost salvaged?
