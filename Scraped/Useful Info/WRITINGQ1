CLOUD ISLE IDEAS:
  [ ]CASTLES will be Baby Pegusas Minigame Quests + Timed Games.
  [ ]Girl in the Tower -  Rapunzel
  [ ]Candy landish area 
  [ ]Little Cat house?
  [ ]Pegasus Statues
  [ ]Sign Following
  [ ]Cotton Candy Trees. . Spawn.. cotten candy?
  [ ]NEW TILE?: Old Shoe HOuse
  [ ]NEW TILE?:Apple or Watermelon house
  

PIRATE ISLE:

  [X]GHOST RECON: Recover 3 Manifest Logs off the 3 ghost ships.   This will require convincing each dingy operator to take you to each boat,  use magnifying glass on boat,  and then head back.
  [ ]ANTIQUITIES: Bring back important objects to this store owner,  has you search all of the empty treasuere chests around the isle  (im sure we might have missed somethhin)
  [X]Black Bart wants anchors from the ship wrecks, maybe get one from skull too
  [X]Dirty Nathaniel likes Cannonball Cate, deliver notes between them since they're in different factions
  

WRITING/ADVENTURES IDEAS:

PLAYER: bleasi:  centaurs and a Brook Horse (Scandinavian legend about a mythological white horse that lures people to ride on it and then carries them off to sea and drowns them) That is of course a little violent legend but it'd be nice with a horse that sometimes comes up from the sea to roam a beach somewhere. :)
PLAYER: Featheredequine: Beauty/music contest between Harmony and Melody...  talk to a bunch of people...  don't really want one to win... make both happy somehow
NEVERENDIGN STORY HORSE: Atreyu, his horse Artax

Random locaitons that could be the basis for a story:
[ ] you could make up an island adventure quest...  I can put whatever you like on
    one of the empty little islands. . .  Some resident some where can offer to "take
    you to thier island,  or relatives, etc.."   ormaybe even take you treasure hunting. . .
    that transports you to the island and then blalblabla :)
[ ]old rickity shack above flipperton
    In the description there talks of many tiny little pieces of paper on the ground..
    Upon using magnifying glass,   you find a note that talks of the old owners need to Leave town.
    He left his lifes savings to anyone there that is worthy of finding it.
    This first scrap starts you on a clue chase around flipperton.
    he used to work in flipperton general store,  so a clue could be found there with magnifying glass also :)
    Eventually its a nice big treasure.
[X] single cabin in grass spot in southern Center on Desert Isle %goto 516,456
[X]  igloo at the northernmost part of the world  %goto 525,18
[ ]  use a magnifying glass at a certain pyramid to find heiroglyphics blocks or something for someone..
    One of the residents of hotton is a Heiroglyphics expert.   but he has mobility issues.
    Using magnifying glass on each pyramid you can find Tablets and return them to him.
[ ]  Beach shack on the huge horseisle beach.  . %goto 527,256
     Using a magnfying glass,  you find an old family photo.  Upon looking at it,  you see it belongs to some
     resident in treeton.   Returning it to them is rewarded.
[ ]  Another adventure on quiet isle
    Rafikis mother could have something needed ..   etc..
[ ]  SANTA!  Santa needs to have a cool adventure. . . There's already a reindeer wandering christmas isle,  one adventure could be to let the reindeer know he has to work a double-shift this season :) %GOTO santa
[X]  Spider aka charlottes web spoof  %GOTO NPC SPIDER
     The spider communicates with you slowly be drawing in web.
     Eventually it makes a trade with you.   A Super-secret treasure location for a Pet Spider.

Some Horse Characters to center stories around/allow encountering NPC's
     Unicorn, Zorro, Pegasus, Lone Ranger, Shadowfax, Hidalgo,
     BLack Beauty, Black Stallion, Misty of chincoteague, Seabiscuit, Manowar, Tornado,
     Fatty Lumpkin, Flicka, Mr Ed, Epona??
