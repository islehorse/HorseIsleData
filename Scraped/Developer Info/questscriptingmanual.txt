=========================================QUEST / ADVENTURES MANUAL============================================

OVERVIEW:
About 1/3 of the Fun of the game should be lots of "Quests" Or "Adventures".
These are "Events"  That are activated by Talking with a NPC script (resident of horseisle) Or
using one of the TOOLS at a particular x,y in the world.

HOW MANY? WHERE?
MOST non shops (cabin owners) should have quests.  And a few shops owners should have quests.
So ,  store owners can give info on the products they sell, tips, etc ,  rather than lots of quests.
But most non-shop NPCS should offer quests,  or take part in them some way.  to make them worth talking to.

QUEST TOOLS: 
  Shovel - For digging for something buried at the location
  Rake - For uncovering SOmething hidden in leaves/ brush /tall grass/flowers/snow /sand
  Binoculars - For Searching a location for something you cant normally see, Up in a tree, or off to the sides a it, etc..
  Magnifying Glass - For finding small details, clues/tiny things at a location (could be used inside buildings!)

QUEST IDEA EXAMPLES: (lots more,  be creative in structure for variation)
  #1: Object Conversion - NPC takes one object and some money? and converts it to something better
     Variation: Object building, NPC takes 2 objects,  and combines them into something else for you!
     Variation: Object dissassemble, NPC takes an object, and gives you 2 parts out of it?
  #2: Delivery - NPC askes you to deliver an object to someone else,  gives you unique quest object.
        Other NPC requires that unique quest object - Can be continued in reverse By using "REQUIRED Quests"
  #3: Find something an NPC has had buried, or something buried that they want and give hints to.
  #4: NPC will buy an object at a premium..  Logs up in chillton? 
  #5: Paying NPC's Money or desired object for Helpful Information - Buried treasure - hidden npc's - forest maze locations
     Variations: $ for tips on Pyramid maze's - $ for tips on AntHill Quests
  #6: NPC gives something cheap to the player for free, just to be kind (offering Tea) Limit to ex. 5 times
     Variation: if this is something special,  someone somewhere else may want it!
  #7: Player can be asked to find clues in a certain building or Place (Using Magnifying Glass)
  #8: Player can be asked to find something lost on the forest floor,  or in tall grass, etc.. by using a rake
  #9: Player Can search a particular Location For Objects/info Using Binoculars



REWARDS FOR COMPLETING A QUEST:
Award "Experience"  for quests that #1: are limited in repeats and tracked, #2: are a little difficult.
For finding the Fin's anchor and bringing it back,  maybe 50 experience.  For doing something more 
complicated,  maybe 200 All quests should be "Medium intelligence"   Nothing too hard.  and also 
should not require using a tool more than 10-20 times to search. Example:  Rather than saying: "It's 
buried in eartip forest" - say "It's buried in Eastern Eartip forest" - which is only about 8 tiles
Try to be as clear as possible: on a delievery quest, rather than just saying,  please deliver to bob 
in flipperton, say "bob's small cabin in the southern end of flipperton"

Nothing of value should really be given away for free too many times.  A few cups of tea is good,  but
 not unlimited. And anything valuable,  should be limited.  and hopefully its a reward for doing SOMETHING.












-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   CREATING A QUEST OPTIONS WALKTHROUGH:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MISC NOTES: Please be descriptive add good notes to each quest.  When we get 100's of quests,  they 
will be a pain to sort through. Please put Main character's name, and a description of the transaction

ADVENTURE TITLE: Very Few Quests Are titled, Only the last step of an "Adventure Quest" Should be titled.
  IF given a title,  this quest shows up as completed or not in players ADVENTURE LOG (under stats)
  Titled adventures are ones that can Only Be COMPLETED ONCE, and they Award Quest Points.
  These are the "Fun" Adventures,  Helping someone out, etc.  Try to title the adventure starting with the
  Main NPC/residents name. So that A player can figure out where to start the adventure.
  

ALT ACTIVATION: Alternate ways of activating the "Action"
    Selecting SHOVEL and an x,y   (Get X,Y by using %? admin command!)  WIll cause the action to take place
          when a player DIGS at that spot
    like wise RAKE rewuires a raking at that spot, etc.
-------------------------------
TRACK PLAYER COMPLETIONS: whter or not to keep track of how many times an action has been done.
  Normally It's YES and 1 time.  For instance, digging up something that buried,  if it was untracked,
  A person could continue to dig the same object up over and over.
  Instances for not Trackes,  with 1 repeat:
       Character handing out tea - to be polite,  you may give it out 5 times,  and then stop.  This is
              done with TRACKING YES,  and 5 repeats.
       Character buying logs from you at a premium. .  No need to track this at all,  it's just a simple
              transaction,  that can be completed a thousand times if they want.

MONEY REQUIRED: Player must give this money to complete quest (buying something from npc)

COMPLETED QUEST REQUIRED: This quest ID must have already been completed by player! It needs to have 
           been a tracked quest, otherwise, It wont know!

OBJECTS REQUIRED: Player must give these objects to complete quest

FAIL RESPONSE: Character, or status says this when player does not meet the requirements above.
-------------------------------
MONEY GAINED: player given this $$ after completing

QUEST POINTS GAINED: For Titled Quest only,  after successfully completing an adventure

OBJECT GAINED: player given these objects on success

SET FUTURE NPC CHATPOINT: From now on, This character will Start talking to you At this Chatpoint instead 
      of normal 0.  This is great for having them say something new,  or start an entire new conversation 
      after completing a quest for them.

JUMP PLAYER TO: x,y  this allows for transporting a player someplace.  Galvin takes you on a boat ride to 
      his island, etc..

SUCCESS RESPONSE: Character says this too you if successfully completed

SUCCESS INFO: This text is added to the bottom right chat box,  Good for recording the details of the Event.

=====================================================================================


Finally,  to attach the Quest to A NPC Chatscript,  After saving the Quest,  look in the List to find 
it's ID number.  On a new chatpoint Put the Quest ID number all by itself on the chatpoint.   No need 
to type anything for what the character will say,  becasue they will say either the FAIL RESPONSE  or 
SUCCESS RESPONSE

Make sure in your conversations,  the player knows what they are doing when activating a quest.
The Player shoudl have to click a reply similar to "Sure, I'll buy an apple from you for $10!"
and then that reply should jump them to the blank chatpoint with The Respective QUEST ID.



whew... Lots of options, but setting them up is pretty easy. 
    Ok..  Now for a few Creation walkthroughs:

 See the existing Quests for more examples 










NEW CUSTOM QUEST OBJECTS!   If you want a new object made specific for your quest,  Cool!
Just tell Joe to make whatever you need.  About 1/2 of adventure quests will prolly have thier own object.
So,  Just Give me the name of the object,  and Description,  And I'll set it right up :)

FOr instance A "Love note to suzy"  is an object i could make quick.  Then you could use it in your quest.
